"""Source recent transcripts from the EXISTING reflect queue.

This is the ``issues`` mode's manifest builder. Rather than re-scanning
``~/.claude/projects`` (agent-deck's approach, with its hardcoded conductor
path), it reads the same ``~/.reflect/pending_reflections.jsonl`` queue that
``stop_reflect.py`` / ``precompact_reflect.py`` already append to. That queue
IS the list of recent, signal-bearing transcripts — reusing it is the whole
point of "new mode, not parallel pipeline".

Each queue line looks like::

    {"ts": "...", "session_id": "...", "transcript_path": "/abs/x.jsonl",
     "trigger": "stop", "cwd": "/abs/project"}

We de-duplicate by resolved transcript path (a long session can be enqueued by
both PreCompact and Stop), keep only paths that still exist on disk, and return
the most recent ``limit`` entries (newest first by queue order, which is append
order).
