"""Issue candidate model + deduplication.

Ported from agent-deck's ``list_candidates.py`` / ``file_issue.py`` dedupe
logic, but keyed off reflect-kb's own state dir instead of agent-deck's
per-conductor manifest.

Three dedup layers, cheapest first:

1. **In-batch** — two candidates from the same run that slugify to the same
   fingerprint collapse to one.
2. **Local ledger** — ``filed_issues.json`` under ``REFLECT_STATE_DIR`` records
   every issue this tool has filed. A fingerprint present there is skipped. This
   is what makes a second run idempotent even offline.
3. **Remote** — ``gh issue list`` titles (open + closed) are fetched once;
   an exact-fingerprint match (``dup-on-github``) OR a high symmetric-Jaccard
   token overlap with a minimum shared-token floor (``dup-on-github-overlap``)
   marks a candidate as already-on-GitHub. The two are surfaced distinctly so a
   reviewer can tell an exact suppression from a softer fuzzy one.

The fingerprint is ``slugify(title)`` (lowercase, non-alphanumerics → ``-``,
truncated at 60 chars) — identical to agent-deck so a port of an existing
ledger stays compatible.
