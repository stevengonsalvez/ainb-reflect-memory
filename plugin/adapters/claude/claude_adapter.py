"""Claude Code adapter for the reflect-kb plugin (v4 §Phase 2 adapter work).

This is a thin wrapper that plugs reflect-kb into the Claude Code `.claude`
layout on a user's machine. It:

  1. Writes the full plugin SKILL.md content into
     ``~/.claude/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`` so Claude's skill discovery
     picks them up with real workflow guidance. (Earlier versions wrote a
     pointer stub that referenced the source path — Claude Code's skill
     loader does NOT dereference that ``source:`` field, so the pointer
     pattern silently loaded 12 lines of "see source" and agents improvised
     everything else. The adapter now copies content directly; a
     ``managed_by:`` sentinel in frontmatter still lets uninstall recognise
     adapter-written files.) Re-run ``install --force`` after each
     ``/plugin update`` to mirror the refreshed plugin content.
  2. Merges a SessionStart hook snippet into ``~/.claude/settings.json`` so
     the recall skill fires on session start.

Both steps support ``--dry-run`` (report intent, no filesystem changes) and
are idempotent. The Claude harness is the only one with hook parity; Codex
and Copilot still use the inherited pointer-stub pattern (their own loaders
may or may not dereference ``source:`` — see their respective adapters).

Usage::

    python claude_adapter.py install --dry-run
    python claude_adapter.py install
    python claude_adapter.py install --force        # overwrite hand-written siblings
    python claude_adapter.py install --no-hooks     # skip settings.json merge
    python claude_adapter.py uninstall

Most of the install/uninstall mechanics live on :class:`AdapterBase`. The
Claude-specific pieces are the SessionStart hook injection and the
``_pointer_body`` override that writes full content instead of a stub.
