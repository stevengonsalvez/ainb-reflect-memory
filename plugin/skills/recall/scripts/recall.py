Reflect Recall — hybrid retrieval from the global learnings KB.

Wraps the `reflect` CLI (reflect-kb, installed via `uv tool install reflect-kb`)
as a subprocess so we inherit GraphRAG + embeddings without pulling the
nano-graphrag dep chain into this plugin.

Usage:
    recall.py <query> [--limit N] [--mode naive|local|global]
                      [--confidence HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|ANY]
                      [--format markdown|json]
                      [--max-chars 2000]
                      [--no-cache]
                      [--cache-ttl 3600]
                      [--no-mmr] [--mmr-lambda 0.7]
                      [--field rule]

Exit codes:
    0 = success (including empty results when KB absent — see D9)
