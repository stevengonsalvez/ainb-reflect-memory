# Reflect: Status - Metrics & Review

Show the current state of the reflect system: metrics, pending reviews, sidecar
coverage, and GraphRAG health. Also handles review of pending low-confidence items.

## When to Use

- To check how many learnings have been captured
- To review pending low-confidence items
- To audit sidecar coverage (find knowledge notes missing sidecars)
- To check GraphRAG health (node/edge counts)
- To see which agents have been updated most

## Status View

When invoked, display the following sections:

### 1. Reflect State

```bash
python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/state_manager.py status
```

Shows:
- Auto-reflect: enabled/disabled
- Last reflection: timestamp
- Pending reviews: count

### 2. Aggregate Metrics

```bash
python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/metrics_updater.py --show
```

Shows:
- Sessions analyzed
- Total signals detected
- Changes proposed / accepted (acceptance rate)
- Skills created
- Estimated time saved
- Confidence breakdown (high/medium/low)
- Most updated agents (top 5)

### 3. Sidecar Coverage

Check how many knowledge notes have entity sidecars:

```bash
# Count knowledge notes
NOTES=$(find docs/solutions -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

# Count sidecars
SIDECARS=$(find docs/solutions -name "*.entities.yaml" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

# Find notes missing sidecars
for md in $(find docs/solutions -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md" 2>/dev/null); do
    sidecar="${md%.md}.entities.yaml"
    if [[ ! -f "$sidecar" ]]; then
        echo "MISSING: $md"
    fi
done
```

Display:
```
Sidecar Coverage: 15/18 (83%)
Missing sidecars:
  - docs/solutions/build-errors/webpack-chunk-error.md
  - docs/solutions/testing-patterns/playwright-retry.md
  - docs/solutions/api-integrations/stripe-webhook.md
```

**If coverage < 100%**: Suggest running `/reflect:consolidate` to generate missing sidecars.

### 4. GraphRAG Health

```bash
if command -v reflect >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    reflect stats
elif [[ -x "$HOME/.local/bin/reflect" ]]; then
    "$HOME/.local/bin/reflect" stats
fi
```

Shows:
- Total indexed learnings
- Node count (entities)
- Edge count (relationships)
- Last indexing timestamp

### 5. Orphaned Memory Stats

```bash
python3 {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/memory_discovery.py stats
```

Shows:
- Repo name
- Orphaned memory dirs count
- Total lines across all orphaned dirs

**If orphaned dirs > 0**: Suggest running `/reflect:consolidate` to merge them.
**If unindexed memories found**: Suggest running `/reflect:ingest` to index into GraphRAG + QMD.

### 6. Project Memory Health

Check if `.agents/MEMORY.md` exists and its line count:

```bash
if [[ -f .agents/MEMORY.md ]]; then
    LINES=$(wc -l < .agents/MEMORY.md | tr -d ' ')
    echo "Project memory: .agents/MEMORY.md ($LINES/200 lines)"
else
    echo "Project memory: not found (run /reflect:consolidate to create)"
fi
```

### 7. Knowledge Gaps (negative recall)

Every 0-result recall is appended to `~/.reflect/knowledge-gaps.jsonl` by
`recall.py` (normalized query + session id). Queries that came up empty in
**>=2 distinct sessions** are knowledge gaps — users keep asking about them
with no learnings in the KB. This is the curation backlog.

```bash
python3 {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect-status/scripts/knowledge_gaps.py
```

Shows:
- Repeat gaps (normalized-query dedup'd, distinct-session counted)
- Ask counts and last-seen dates
- Total distinct 0-result queries on file

Options: `--min-sessions 1` to include one-off gaps, `--format json` for
programmatic use.

**If repeat gaps exist**: Suggest capturing learnings for those topics via
`/reflect` or `/reflect:ingest` — once indexed, the gap stops recurring.

### 8. Learning Update History

Every UPDATE to a learning snapshots its old form into the `learning_history`
table in `~/.reflect/reflect.db` (and, for knowledge notes, an append-only
`{slug}.history.yaml` sidecar next to the note). Show the update count per
learning:

```bash
python3 {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/reflect_db.py history
```

Shows, per learning (most-updated first):
- Learning id
- Update count (history snapshots recorded)
- Last-updated timestamp
- Title

**If a learning has an unusually high update count**: its belief keeps getting
revised — inspect the snapshots (`learning_history.snapshot_json` or the
`.history.yaml` sidecar) to see why the rule kept changing.

### 9. Contradictions (cross-turn detection)

Every new learning write runs deterministic contradiction detection against
recent in-scope learnings sharing >= 1 concept tag (negation-stripped token
Jaccard > 0.9 with a negation marker in exactly one of the two — e.g. saving
"never use foo" against an existing "use foo"). The OLDER learning is demoted
(`is_latest = 0`, `superseded_by_learning_id` set) and a
`contradiction_detected` audit event is written to the events table in
`~/.reflect/reflect.db`, mirrored to `~/.reflect/events.jsonl`.

```bash
python3 {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/reflect_db.py contradictions
```

Shows:
- Total contradiction count
- Recent contradiction pairs (older id -> newer id, similarity, both titles)

**If contradictions exist**: the demoted side is preserved (history snapshot +
`is_latest = 0`, never deleted) — review the pairs to confirm the newer rule
is actually the correct one; if the flip was wrong, re-state the older rule
so it wins the next round.

## Review Mode

When invoked as `reflect review` or when there are pending items, enter review mode.

### Pending Low-Confidence Items

```bash
python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/state_manager.py pending
```

For each pending item, show:
- Signal text
- Detection date
- Source quote
- Category

**Review actions:**
- `approve N` -- Promote item N to full confidence, apply the change
- `reject N` -- Remove item N from pending queue
- `approve all` -- Promote all pending items
- `reject all` -- Clear all pending items
- `skip` -- Leave pending for later

When approving:
1. Apply the behavioral change or create the knowledge note
2. Generate entity sidecar if knowledge type
3. Index via `reflect add` CLI (reflect-kb)
4. Remove from pending queue:
   ```bash
   # Done internally via state_manager
   python -c "
   import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '{{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts')
   from state_manager import clear_pending_review
   clear_pending_review(INDEX)
   "
   ```
5. Update metrics

### Staleness Check

Flag items that have been pending for more than 7 days:

```
STALE (14 days): "Consider using memoization for expensive renders"
  - Detected: 2026-03-30
  - Recommend: reject (too old, context lost) or approve if still relevant
```

2. [LOW] "Memoize expensive component renders" (12 days, STALE)

Review pending items? (approve N / reject N / skip)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Metrics show 0:**
- Run `/reflect` at least once to initialize metrics
- Check state directory: `ls ~/.reflect/`

**GraphRAG stats unavailable:**
- Check if reflect-kb CLI is installed: `command -v reflect`
- Install if missing: `uv tool install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory.git[graph]'`

**Sidecar count is 0:**
- Knowledge notes may exist without sidecars (pre-v3 behavior)
- Run `/reflect:consolidate` to generate missing sidecars
