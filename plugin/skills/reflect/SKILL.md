# Reflect - Agent Self-Improvement Skill

Transform your AI assistant into a continuously improving partner. Every correction
becomes a permanent improvement that persists across all future sessions.

## Backwards Compatibility

This skill handles the base `/reflect` command. If invoked with sub-command flags,
redirect the user to the appropriate sub-skill:

| Flag | Redirect |
|------|----------|
| `--consolidate` | "Use `/reflect:consolidate` instead." |
| `--ingest-memories` | "Use `/reflect:ingest` instead." |
| `--status` | "Use `/reflect:status` instead." |
| `--review` | "Use `/reflect:status` instead (status includes review)." |
| `--behavioral` | Proceed normally -- behavioral-only scan (skip knowledge extraction). |
| `--knowledge` | Proceed normally -- knowledge-only scan (skip behavioral). |

For `reflect on` and `reflect off`, handle inline (toggle auto-reflect state).
For `reflect [agent-name]`, run behavioral scan scoped to that agent file only.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/reflect` | Full conversation scan: behavioral + knowledge extraction |
| `/reflect --behavioral` | Behavioral corrections only → agent file diffs |
| `/reflect --knowledge` | Knowledge capture only → learning notes + sidecars |
| `/reflect [agent]` | Focus behavioral scan on a specific agent file |
| `/reflect on` | Enable auto-reflection (PreCompact hook) |
| `/reflect off` | Disable auto-reflection |
| `/reflect:consolidate` | Merge orphaned worktree memories → .agents/MEMORY.md |
| `/reflect:ingest` | Global indexer: sweep ALL sources → GraphRAG + QMD |
| `/reflect:status` | Dashboard: metrics, pending reviews, coverage, health |

## When to Use

- After completing complex tasks
- When user explicitly corrects behavior ("never do X", "always Y")
- At session boundaries or before context compaction
- When successful patterns are worth preserving
- When a solved problem should be captured as knowledge

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan Conversation for Signals

Analyze the conversation for **two types** of signals:

1. **Behavioral signals** -- corrections, preferences, rules about how to act
2. **Knowledge signals** -- solved problems, root causes, discovered patterns, decisions

**Signal Confidence Levels:**

| Confidence | Behavioral Triggers | Knowledge Triggers |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **HIGH** | "never", "always", "wrong", "stop", "the rule is" | "root cause was", "fixed by", "the solution was", "chose X over Y" |
| **MEDIUM** | "perfect", "exactly", "that's right", accepted output | "spent 2 hours", "the docs say X but", "misleading error" |
| **LOW** | Patterns that worked but not explicitly validated | "seems to work", "so far so good", implicit success |

See `references/signal_patterns.md` for full detection rules.

### Step 2: Classify & Match to Targets (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Every detected signal MUST be routed to at least one of:
(a) an existing agent/CLAUDE.md file edit, (b) a new skill proposal, or
(c) a knowledge note. Knowledge notes are the **fallback**, not the default.
If a signal has clear behavioral implications, you MUST propose an edit to an
existing agent target — do not skip straight to knowledge-note output.

**Behavioral signals** map to agent files OR existing skills (preferred when domain matches):

| Category | Target Files |
|----------|--------------|
| **Existing skill match** | **`.claude/skills/<name>/skill.md` or `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (EDIT in-place — see Step 2.5)** |
| Code Style | `code-reviewer`, `backend-developer`, `frontend-developer` |
| Architecture | `solution-architect`, `api-architect`, `architecture-reviewer` |
| Process | Agent config file (`CLAUDE.md`), orchestrator agents |
| Domain | Domain-specific agents, agent config file |
| Tools | Agent config file, relevant specialists |
| Security | `security-agent`, `code-reviewer` |
| New Skill | Create new skill file (only when no existing skill matches and quality gates pass — see Step 3) |

See `references/agent_mappings.md` for detailed mapping rules.
See `references/classification_rules.md` for behavioral vs knowledge routing.

### Step 2.5: Match Against Existing Skills (BEFORE falling through to memory)

**Why this step exists**: Operational gotchas (e.g. "publish AD_ID declaration must
be Yes when Firebase is a dep") frequently belong in an existing skill (`publish`,
`shot-testing`, `stripe-webhook-debug`) rather than `.agents/MEMORY.md`. Without
this step, signals default to memory files and skills go stale.

**Build skill index** (cached for 24h, refreshed on `/reflect:status`):

```bash
# Walk skill directories and extract searchable metadata
for skill_md in ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/*/skill.md \
                .claude/skills/*/skill.md .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  [ -f "$skill_md" ] || continue
  # Extract: name (from frontmatter or dirname), description (frontmatter),
  # triggers (frontmatter.triggers), first H1 heading, first paragraph of body
done
```

Output one record per skill:
```yaml
name: publish
path: .claude/skills/publish/skill.md
keywords:
  - publish, testflight, play store, ios, android
  - app store connect, fastlane, xcode, capacitor
  - cap sync, version bump, ad_id, manifest
description: "Publish SHOT mobile apps to TestFlight and Play Store..."
```

**Score signals against each skill**:

For each detected signal, compute keyword overlap with each skill's keyword set
(token Jaccard or embedding cosine if QMD available).

**Routing decision**:

| Match score | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **≥ 0.6** (strong overlap) | **Propose EDIT to that skill** (additive section). Do NOT route to agent or memory file. |
| 0.4–0.6 (candidate) | Present skill edit AND agent edit as alternatives — let user pick. |
| < 0.4 (no match) | Fall through to existing routing (agent file → memory file). |

**Important reuse rule**: A short bullet rule (≤3 lines) STILL routes to a matching
skill. The "≥10 min debugging / Problem-Solution writeup" criterion in Step 3
applies only to NEW skill *creation*, not to edits of existing skills. Skills
naturally accumulate operational bullets in their gotchas / known issues sections.

**What this prevents**: 5 publish-domain learnings landing in `.agents/MEMORY.md`
when `.claude/skills/publish/skill.md` is the natural canonical home for them.

**Knowledge signals** become learning notes:

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| `build-errors` | Compile errors, CI failures, bundling |
| `performance-issues` | Slowdowns, memory leaks, optimization |
| `security-fixes` | Vulnerabilities, auth issues, secrets |
| `testing-patterns` | Test strategies, flaky tests |
| `debugging-sessions` | Complex investigations |
| `architecture-decisions` | Design choices, patterns |
| `api-integrations` | Third-party APIs, SDKs |
| `dependency-issues` | Package conflicts, upgrades |
| `deployment-fixes` | Production incidents |
| `database-migrations` | Schema changes, data fixes |
| `ui-patterns` | Frontend patterns, CSS |
| `tooling-setup` | Dev environment, configs |

**Knowledge note references** (absorbed from compound-docs):
- `references/docs-solutions-template.md` -- template for project-local
  `docs/solutions/{category}/{filename}.md` notes with YAML frontmatter
- `references/critical-patterns.md` -- check for critical patterns that
  must always be flagged (auth, data integrity, security)
- `references/schema.yaml` -- JSON-schema describing valid knowledge notes
- `assets/learning_template.md` -- canonical template for new learnings

### Step 3: Check for NEW Skill Creation

This step decides whether to **CREATE a brand-new skill**. Note: edits to existing
skills are handled in Step 2.5 above; this step only fires when no existing skill
matched and the signal is substantial enough to warrant a new top-level skill.

**Skill-Worthy Criteria (for NEW skill creation):**
- Non-obvious debugging (>10 min investigation)
- Misleading error (root cause different from message)
- Workaround discovered through experimentation
- Configuration insight (differs from documented)
- Reusable pattern (helps in similar situations)

**Quality Gates (must pass all):**
- [ ] Reusable: Will help with future tasks
- [ ] Non-trivial: Requires discovery, not just docs
- [ ] Specific: Can describe exact trigger conditions
- [ ] Verified: Solution actually worked
- [ ] No duplication: Doesn't exist already

See `references/skill_template.md` for skill creation guidelines.

### Step 4: Generate Proposals

Present findings using the reflection template at `assets/reflection_template.md`.
For each knowledge note, use `assets/learning_template.md` to structure the
individual `.md` file (fields: `id`, `scope`, `confidence`, `learning_type`,
`source_episodes`, `superseded_by`, `provenance`, plus Problem/Solution/
Anti-Pattern/Context sections).

#### Structured field extraction (MANDATORY for every knowledge note)

Every learning's frontmatter MUST carry typed, single-purpose fields in
addition to the prose body — recall returns just one of them
(`recall.py --field rule`) instead of injecting a paragraph. Schema
(strict — every key present; use `""` / `[]` when genuinely absent):

```yaml
problem: ""           # string — what went wrong, ONE sentence
root_cause: ""        # string — the underlying cause, ONE sentence
fix: ""               # string — what resolved it, ONE sentence
rule: ""              # string — imperative do/don't to apply next time
category: ""          # string — one of the knowledge categories above
entities: []          # list[string] — specific named tech/tools/errors
causal_relations: []  # list[{source, target, type: caused_by | causes | enables | prevents}]
```

Field rules:
- **Be selective**: keep a signal only when a session 6 months from now
  would still act on it; anything below that bar should not become a
  note at all.
- **Be concise**: prefer a single strong sentence over several weak ones.
  The prose body is the place for the full rationale; the fields are
  distillations.
- **`rule` is the highest-value field**: phrase it as an imperative the
  next session can follow verbatim ("Always X", "Never Y when Z").
- **`entities`**: specific named identifiers only (proper nouns, error
  strings, tool names) — the same entities the Step 5 sidecar expands on.
- **`causal_relations`**: cause→effect chains between entities
  (`type: caused_by | causes | enables | prevents`, mirroring the sidecar's
  typed causal link types). `[]` when the learning has no causal structure.
- **`forget_after` (A3, optional)**: ISO-timestamp TTL for clearly
  time-bounded knowledge — incident workarounds ("avoid X service, it's
  down"), sprint/migration/quarter-scoped rules. The hourly forget sweep
  archives the learning once the timestamp passes. Leave `null` (the
  template default) for durable rules; when in doubt, omit — permanent
  is the safe default.

The prose body (Problem/Solution/Anti-Pattern/Context) stays mandatory —
fields complement it, never replace it. Older free-form notes without
these fields remain valid; recall degrades gracefully for them.

The output must include:

1. **Signals table** -- all detected signals with confidence and category
2. **Proposed skill edits** (NEW in v3.1) -- when Step 2.5 found a matching skill
   (score ≥ 0.6), show the additive section diff for that skill file
3. **Proposed agent updates** -- diffs for each behavioral change that fell
   through to agents
4. **Proposed knowledge notes** -- for each knowledge signal, show:
   - YAML frontmatter preview
   - Entity sidecar preview (entities + relationships)
   - Target path: `docs/solutions/{category}/{filename}.md`
5. **Proposed new skills** -- with quality gate checklist
6. **Conflict check** -- warn if new rules contradict existing
7. **Review prompt** -- allow selective approval

### Step 5: MANDATORY Entity Sidecar Generation

**CRITICAL**: When creating ANY knowledge note, you MUST also generate the
`.entities.yaml` sidecar file alongside the `.md` file. This is the single
most important step for knowledge searchability.

**Entity sidecar format** (see `references/knowledge_format.md` for details):

```yaml
document_id: lrn-{slug}-{hash6}
extracted_at: "{ISO timestamp}"
entities:
  - name: "{entity name}"
    type: technology | error | pattern | function | concept | tool
    description: "{brief description}"
relationships:
  - source: "{entity A}"
    target: "{entity B}"
    type: caused_by | causes | enables | prevents | contradicts | supersedes | part_of | uses | solves | requires | relates_to | implements | configures | triggers
    description: "{how they relate}"
    strength: 1-10
```

**Rules:**
- Extract 3-8 entities per learning (focused, not exhaustive)
- Always include at least one `solves` relationship for bug-fix type
- **Emit typed causal edges (S2)**: when the direction of effect is known,
  use `caused_by` / `causes` / `enables` / `prevents` / `contradicts` /
  `supersedes` / `part_of` / `uses` instead of flat `relates_to` — graph
  queries like "what enabled this fix?" depend on these. `relates_to` is
  the fallback for genuinely undirected association only.
- Strength: 9-10 direct/causal, 5-7 moderate, 1-4 weak
- Entity names normalized to lowercase canonical form
- Use the most specific entity type available

### Step 6: Apply with User Approval

**On `Y` (approve):**
1. Apply each behavioral change using Edit tool
2. Write knowledge notes to `docs/solutions/{category}/`
3. Write entity sidecar alongside each knowledge note
4. Index globally (validates sidecar first to catch schema errors early):
   ```bash
   SIDECAR="docs/solutions/{category}/{filename}.entities.yaml"
   DOC="docs/solutions/{category}/{filename}.md"
   VALIDATE="{{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/validate_sidecar.py"

   if command -v reflect >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       # Validate before ingest — malformed sidecars fail loudly here, not
       # silently at GraphRAG time
       uv run "$VALIDATE" --strict "$SIDECAR" || {
           echo "ERROR: sidecar validation failed for $SIDECAR" >&2
           exit 1
       }
       # --force skips the interactive y/N prompt; content-hash doc_id makes
       # the call idempotent so re-runs no-op cleanly.
       reflect add "$DOC" --entities "$SIDECAR" --force
   fi
   ```
   Capture → index is now closed: every accepted learning flows into GraphRAG
   + QMD immediately, so the next session's SessionStart recall will surface
   it via the retrieval hook.
5. Create episode note (auto, no approval needed)
6. Update metrics:
   ```bash
   python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/metrics_updater.py \
       --accepted N --rejected M --confidence high:X,medium:Y,low:Z \
       --agents "agent1,agent2" --skills S
   ```
7. Update state:
   ```bash
   python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/state_manager.py status
   ```
8. Commit with descriptive message

**On `N` (reject):**
1. Discard proposed changes
2. Log rejection for analysis

**On `modify`:**
1. Present each change individually
2. Allow editing before applying

**On selective (e.g., `1,3` or `k1,k2` or `s1` or `e1,e2`):**
1. Apply only specified changes
2. `1,3` = agent changes 1 and 3
3. `k1,k2` = knowledge notes 1 and 2
4. `s1` = skill 1 (new skill creation)
5. `e1,e2` = existing skill edits 1 and 2 (Step 2.5 matches)
6. `all-knowledge` = all knowledge notes, skip others
7. `all-skills` = all new skill creations, skip agent updates
8. `all-skill-edits` = all existing skill edits, skip new skill creations

### Step 7: Episode Note (Auto)

After applying changes, automatically create an episode note.
Episode notes are raw session snapshots for provenance -- they do NOT require approval.

Use template at `assets/episode_template.md`.

## Belief Revision on Ingest (Drain)

When `/reflect` runs headlessly from the drain, the cascade slice may carry a
`## Related existing learnings (belief revision)` section: existing learnings
whose titles overlap this session's signals, plus the exact `revise` command
to execute against them. When that section is present, every finding maps to
exactly ONE structured action instead of unconditionally creating a new note:

| Action | When | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| `CREATE` | genuinely new knowledge — no listed learning covers the same rule/facet | new learning row (`proof_count` starts at 1) |
| `UPDATE` | finding restates a listed learning (same rule, fix, or decision) | merges as evidence: `proof_count`++, transcript appended to `source_memory_ids`, history snapshot recorded |
| `DELETE` | new evidence directly contradicts or supersedes a listed learning | retires it non-destructively: status → `reverted` + reason; history snapshot kept |

**Revision rules:**
- **PREFER UPDATE OVER CREATE**: one canonical learning with many proofs beats
  near-duplicate siblings. Re-observed evidence strengthens; it never duplicates.
- Match by the specific rule/facet, not by general topic — "never use var"
  updates only the var learning, not every TypeScript learning.
- Be very conservative with `DELETE` — only when directly contradicted or
  superseded, never just because a learning is old.
- Every action carries a one-sentence `reason` (audited to catch duplicate creates).
- **Time-bounded CREATEs (A3)**: when the new knowledge is clearly scoped to a
  window — an incident workaround, a sprint/migration/quarter-specific rule —
  add an optional `forget_after: "<ISO timestamp>"` so the hourly forget sweep
  archives it once the window closes. Omit for durable knowledge; permanent is
  the default.

**Action contract** (JSON array handed to the cascade):

```json
[{"action": "UPDATE", "target_id": "<id>", "reason": "restates existing rule"},
 {"action": "DELETE", "target_id": "<id>", "reason": "superseded by new fix"},
 {"action": "CREATE", "content": "<one-line learning>", "reason": "no existing match"},
 {"action": "CREATE", "content": "<incident workaround>", "reason": "scoped to incident",
  "forget_after": "2026-07-01T00:00:00+00:00"}]
```

Execute via the cascade (stdlib-only, no engine deps):

```bash
python3 {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/reflect_cascade.py revise \
    --source "<transcript-path>" \
    --actions '[{"action":"UPDATE","target_id":"<id>","reason":"..."}]'
```

The interactive `/reflect` flow is unchanged — this section only applies when
the input explicitly carries the related-learnings block.

### Auto Skill Refresh (R13)

Skills are promoted from learnings once and would otherwise drift as the
corpus evolves. Belief revision closes that loop automatically — no manual
step in this skill is required:

1. When a `revise` UPDATE/DELETE lands on a learning whose title tokens or
   category overlap an indexed skill's `tags` (the R20 `skills` table in
   `reflect.db`), that skill is flagged `is_stale`.
2. Stale skills stop matching in the SessionStart inject tier immediately —
   a skill with possibly-outdated guidance never wins over raw learnings.
3. A `skill_refresh` task is queued in `~/.reflect/pending_reflections.jsonl`
   (`transcript_path` = the SKILL.md, `trigger` = `skill_refresh`, at most one
   pending task per skill). The background drain consumes it by re-running
   the skill-edit step (Step 2.5 shape: re-read the SKILL.md, check current
   learnings for its domain, edit in place).
4. Regenerating the SKILL.md (mtime change) — or a completed refresh run —
   clears the flag and the skill re-enters the inject matcher.

The `revise` summary reports the back-reaction as `skills_marked_stale` and
`refreshes_queued`.

## Consolidated Observations (O1, second drain pass)

The drain emits TWO output streams: raw corrections (the belief-revision
actions above) AND aggregated, persona/convention-shaped **observations**
that accumulate evidence over time. Without this layer, open-domain queries
("what conventions does this codebase use?", "what does this team prefer?")
surface 5 raw corrections and force the agent to aggregate them in-context.

| Layer | Shape | Frontmatter `type` | Example |
|-------|-------|--------------------|---------|
| correction (learning) | one specific rule/fix | `learning` | "Never use `var` in TypeScript" |
| observation | persona/convention aggregate | `observation` | "This team prefers strict typing over `any`" |
| skill | workflow (how to do X) | — | "How to publish to TestFlight" |

When the cascade slice carries a `## Consolidated observations` section, run
a SECOND pass after executing the revision actions: for every
persona/convention-shaped finding, emit exactly one observation action
against the listed existing observations:

```json
[{"action": "UPDATE", "target_id": "<obs id>",
  "source_correction_ids": ["<learning ids>"], "reason": "more evidence"},
 {"action": "CREATE", "content": "Team prefers conventional commits",
  "source_correction_ids": ["<learning ids>"], "reason": "no existing aggregate"},
 {"action": "DELETE", "target_id": "<obs id>", "reason": "convention dropped"}]
```

Execute via the cascade (stdlib-only, no engine deps):

```bash
python3 {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/reflect_cascade.py observe \
    --actions '[{"action":"UPDATE","target_id":"<id>","source_correction_ids":["<lrn-id>"],"reason":"..."}]'
```

**Observation rules:**
- **PREFER UPDATE OVER CREATE**: evidence accumulates — 50 "team prefers X"
  corrections collapse into ONE observation with `proof_count: 50`, never
  50 sibling aggregates.
- `UPDATE` appends `source_correction_ids` uniquely and bumps `proof_count`
  by the number of NEW ids; the pre-update form is snapshotted into
  `observation_history` first, so history is never lost. Cite the learning
  ids from the related-learnings block and the `created_ids` field of the
  `revise` summary.
- `UPDATE` may rewrite `content` as the aggregate wording evolves — the old
  wording survives in `observation_history`.
- `DELETE` retires non-destructively (`status: retired` + reason). Only when
  the convention demonstrably no longer holds.
- Observation notes written to disk use `assets/observation_template.md`
  (frontmatter `type: observation`); raw correction learnings keep
  `assets/learning_template.md`.

**Retrieval tier**: observations are a separate tier in `reflect.db`
(`observations` table). Open-domain queries surface the observation tier
FIRST — proof-ranked aggregates before raw corrections — via
`recall_observation_tier` / `recall_tiered`; closed-domain lookups ("how do
I fix X?") skip the tier entirely.

## Toggle Auto-Reflect

```
reflect on   -> python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/state_manager.py on
reflect off  -> python {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/reflect/scripts/state_manager.py off
```

## State Management

Reflect persists state in `~/.reflect/` SQLite via `reflect_db.py` (toggle, pending
low-confidence queue, drained reflections, errors). Inspect or operate via the
`reflect:status` skill or the `reflect metrics` / `reflect stats` CLI
subcommands (from `reflect-kb`).

## Safety Guardrails

### Human-in-the-Loop
- NEVER apply changes without explicit user approval
- Always show full diff before applying
- Allow selective application

### Incremental Updates
- ONLY add to existing sections
- NEVER delete or rewrite existing rules
- Preserve original structure

### Conflict Detection
- Check if proposed rule contradicts existing
- Warn user if conflict detected
- Suggest resolution strategy

## Output Locations

Reflect signals land in one of four v3 homes depending on scope.

**Behavioral corrections (encode in the responsible agent definition):**
- `~/.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md` — direct edit to agent rules
- `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` — when a new skill is the right home

**Project-scoped knowledge (auto-loaded next session in this project):**
- `~/.claude/projects/<HASH>/memory/{type}_{slug}.md` — auto-memory entries.
  `<HASH>` is the git-root path encoded by Claude Code; the statusline MEM row
  surfaces writes here.
- `~/.claude/projects/<HASH>/memory/MEMORY.md` — index pointing at the above.

**Cross-project / generic knowledge (queryable via `/recall` from any session):**
- `reflect add <file>` → `~/.learnings/documents/{id}.md` plus a
  `{id}.entities.yaml` sidecar (flat top-level under `documents/` — the CLI
  picks the destination; older subdirs like `documents/learnings/` are from
  prior layouts, do not target them); auto-indexed into GraphRAG + QMD. Use
  this for system-level findings, library quirks, or behavioural patterns
  that aren't tied to any one repo. If the signal doesn't belong to any
  specific project, go straight here — no project-scoped intermediate step
  required.

**In-repo solution notes (versioned with code, harvested by `/reflect:ingest`):**
- `docs/solutions/{category}/{name}.md` + `{name}.entities.yaml`

Legacy paths (`~/.reflect/learnings.yaml`, `~/.claude/session/learnings.yaml`,
`~/.reflect/reflect-metrics.yaml`) are no longer canonical. Do not write there.

## Examples

### Example 1: Behavioral Correction

**User says**: "Never use `var` in TypeScript, always use `const` or `let`"

**Signal detected**:
- Type: Behavioral
- Confidence: HIGH (explicit "never" + "always")
- Category: Code Style
- Target: `frontend-developer.md`

**Proposed change**:
```diff
## Style Guidelines
+ * Use `const` or `let` instead of `var` in TypeScript
```

### Example 2: Knowledge Signal - Solved Bug

**Context**: Spent 30 minutes debugging a React hydration mismatch

**Signal detected**:
- Type: Knowledge
- Confidence: HIGH (non-trivial debugging with confirmed fix)
- Category: debugging-sessions
- Learning Type: bug-fix

**Proposed knowledge note**: `docs/solutions/debugging-sessions/react-hydration-mismatch.md`

**Proposed entity sidecar**: `docs/solutions/debugging-sessions/react-hydration-mismatch.entities.yaml`
```yaml
entities:
  - name: "react"
    type: technology
    description: "UI library for building component-based interfaces"
  - name: "hydration mismatch"
    type: error
    description: "Server-rendered HTML doesn't match client render"
  - name: "suppressHydrationWarning"
    type: function
    description: "React prop to suppress hydration mismatch warnings"
relationships:
  - source: "dynamic content in SSR"
    target: "hydration mismatch"
    type: caused_by
    description: "Server and client render different content for dynamic values"
    strength: 9
  - source: "useEffect mounted check"
    target: "hydration mismatch"
    type: solves
    description: "Defer dynamic content to client-only rendering"
    strength: 10
```

### Example 3: Both Types in One Session

**Session**: User corrects TypeScript style AND solves a tricky async bug

**Output**:
1. Agent update proposal (behavioral) for `frontend-developer.md`
2. Knowledge note + entity sidecar (knowledge) for `docs/solutions/build-errors/`
3. Episode note linking both learnings

### Example 4: Existing Skill Match (NEW in v3.1)

**Context**: While shipping a Play Store release, user discovered that
"Advertising ID" declaration must be set to "Yes + Analytics" when Firebase
is a dep, and that `npx cap sync` updates `build.gradle` versionCode (which
must be committed alongside `npm version` bumps).

**Step 2.5 skill index** finds:
```yaml
name: publish
path: .claude/skills/publish/skill.md
keywords: [publish, play store, testflight, cap sync, version bump,
           ad_id, manifest, fastlane, app store, capacitor]
```

**Score**: signal keywords {ad_id, declaration, cap sync, versionCode, capacitor}
overlap heavily with the `publish` skill keyword set → **score 0.78** ≥ 0.6.

**Proposed skill edit** (NOT a memory file edit, NOT a new skill):

```diff
# .claude/skills/publish/skill.md
## Android Build Gotchas
+ * `npx cap sync` updates `android/app/build.gradle` versionCode/versionName.
+   Commit alongside `npm version` bumps — otherwise build.gradle drifts.
+ * Capacitor plugin install ≠ registration: cap sync writes 3 files
