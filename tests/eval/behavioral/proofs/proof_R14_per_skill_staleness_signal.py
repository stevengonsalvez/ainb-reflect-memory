# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for port R14 — per-skill computed staleness flag.

# ABOUTME: over a real sqlite DB: a skill whose backing learning's freshness signal moved
# ABOUTME: PAST its last_refreshed_at is flagged stale, an untouched sibling skill is not,

# ABOUTME: the flag is a pure function of the real freshness signal, no LLM, no torch model.
"""Port R14: per-skill staleness flag computed on read (hindsight
``compute_mental_model_is_stale`` shape).

INVARIANT (storage surface, decisive by the freshness SIGNAL):
  Each indexed skill carries a computed ``is_stale`` flag derived from a real
  freshness signal — the effective update time of its in-scope learnings
  (creation ``created_at``, or the newest ``learning_history`` snapshot for any
  mutation) versus the skill's own ``last_refreshed_at``. A skill is stale iff
  some in-scope learning changed AFTER the skill was last refreshed.

  Two sibling skills index the SAME DB. Skill A's backing learning is mutated
  so its history timestamp lands AFTER A's refresh → A flips stale. Skill B's
  backing learning is untouched (signal stays BEFORE B's refresh) → B stays
  fresh. This isolates the port: same engine, same read, only the per-skill
  signal differs.

  Then we FLIP THE SIGNAL: move A's backing-learning history timestamp back to
  BEFORE A's refresh and the computed flag flips back to fresh; move it forward
  again and it flips stale again. The flag tracks the signal in both
  directions, proving it is *computed from* the signal, not an incidental
  stored bit. The stored R13 column is never written — read-time only.

WHY NO LLM / NO TORCH: every assertion is over (a) sqlite rows written by the
real reflect_db ops and (b) the deterministic datetime comparison inside
``compute_skills_staleness``. The computation is pure: parse two ISO-8601
timestamps, compare, AND a tokenized scope match. No embedding model, no
cross-encoder, no ranker, no LLM participates. The only thing that flips the
flag is the pinned timestamp literal we move across the refresh floor.

This is a *storage*-surface port (the bead labels it retrieval because the flag
feeds the R11 inject short-circuit, but the runtime-observable invariant lives
in reflect_db), so per the harness contract we drive the real module directly
rather than the file-KB recall harness.
