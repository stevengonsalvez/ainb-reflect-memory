# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for SG7 — TodoWrite completion as a capture SIGNAL. Driving the

# ABOUTME: pending->in_progress->completed emits exactly ONE Process learning attributing the

"""SG7: PostToolUse TodoWrite-completion capture signal.

Port SG7 is a SIGNAL/CAPTURE port — its behaviour lives in the PostToolUse hook
path (``plugins/reflect/hooks/posttooluse_minilearning.py`` ->
``plugins/reflect/scripts/todo_state.py``), NOT in recall.py. There is no
retrieval and no embedding model involved, so this proof drives the REAL
``todo_state`` module functions the hook calls (``observe_todowrite``,
``record_file_event``) against a hermetic on-disk state dir + learnings dir.

The TRUE invariant (read off the real diff, commit be301020):

  A todo item produces a candidate "how I accomplished X" learning ONLY when it
  transitions TO ``status='completed'`` *from a PRIOR recorded non-completed
  status*. The detector keys off the per-session state diff:

      if item.status == 'completed'
         and old is not None              # there is a prior recorded entry
         and old.status != 'completed':   # and it wasn't already completed
              -> emit learning

  An item that arrives *already* completed on its first observation has no prior
  baseline to diff against (``old is None``) and is SKIPPED — observe_todowrite
  returns None and writes no learning file. That prior-status baseline IS the
  load-bearing knob: flipping it (present vs absent) flips emission on/off, so
  the signal is caused by the real diff logic and not by the text of the item.

DECISIVE knob ON vs OFF (the same item content in both arms):

  ARM (knob ON  — prior baseline present):
      observe(pending) -> observe(in_progress) -> record file event ->
      observe(completed)
    => observe_todowrite returns {"completed":[...]} for the LAST call,
       exactly ONE learning file is written, and that file's frontmatter is
       category: Process / confidence: medium / source: todo-completion, names
       the file touched while in_progress, and carries a duration_s.

  CONTROL (knob OFF — no prior baseline):
      observe(completed) as the very FIRST observation of the item
    => observe_todowrite returns None and ZERO learning files are written.

If SG7 were absent (no observe_todowrite call wired, or a broken diff that
emitted on any completed status), the CONTROL arm would ALSO emit a learning and
the test would FAIL. If SG7 never emitted, the ARM would produce no file and the
test would FAIL. No LLM participates: the seeds (todo lists) plus the
prior-status flip fully determine each assertion.
