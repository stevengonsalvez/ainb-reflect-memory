"""SG3: session idle trigger for natural reflection (the idle SWEEP).

Port SG3 (commit e60bf30c, "feat(reflect): idle-session sweep with speculative
down-rank") has TWO surfaces that the commit message conflates: the idle SWEEP
(a signal/scheduling trigger in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/reflect_gate.py``) and
a speculative down-rank multiplier in recall.py. The bead title (SG3 = "session
idle trigger for natural reflection") and the surface tag (signal) name the
SWEEP. RECALL_SPECULATIVE_ALPHA is the *consequence* of the sweep's tag, not the
trigger itself — so the real SG3 to prove here is ``reflect_gate.idle_sweep``,
the function the launchd timer (``hooks/idle_reflect.sh --idle-sweep``) calls.

This is a SIGNAL/SCHEDULING port: there is no retrieval, no embedding model, and
no LLM. The proof therefore drives the REAL module functions the hook calls
(``scan_idle_transcripts`` + ``idle_sweep``) against hermetic on-disk transcript,
queue and state files, with mtimes pinned via os.utime to LITERAL ages.

The TRUE invariant (read off the real diff):

    A transcript is in the idle window iff
        threshold_sec <= (now - mtime) <= max_age_sec
    Only transcripts in that window are scanned, and an in-window transcript that
    passes the (cheap, deterministic) signal gate is enqueued with
    trigger='idle' and speculative=True. A transcript whose quiet gap is BELOW
    the threshold is not even a candidate — it is never scanned and never
    enqueued. The default threshold is 600s (REFLECT_IDLE_THRESHOLD_SEC), and
    the threshold is a real parameter of idle_sweep/scan_idle_transcripts.

DECISIVE knob ON vs OFF (idle gap vs threshold; same transcript CONTENT both arms):

  ARM (knob ON  — gap PAST threshold):
      a signal-bearing transcript with mtime 700s old, threshold 600s
    => scan_idle_transcripts finds it; idle_sweep enqueues exactly ONE entry
       with trigger='idle', speculative=True, session_id = transcript stem.

  CONTROL (knob OFF — gap UNDER threshold):
      the SAME signal-bearing transcript content with mtime 30s old, threshold 600s
    => scan_idle_transcripts finds nothing; idle_sweep enqueues ZERO entries and
       writes no queue lines.

If SG3 were absent (no idle sweep wired) the ARM would enqueue nothing and the
test would FAIL. If the threshold gate were broken (level-triggered on any
transcript) the CONTROL would ALSO enqueue and the test would FAIL. The
configurability arm additionally pins that the threshold is a real knob: raising
the threshold above the gap turns the SAME transcript from enqueued to skipped.
No LLM participates — the pinned mtimes plus the threshold fully determine every
assertion (detect_signals, the only dependency, is a deterministic regex gate).
