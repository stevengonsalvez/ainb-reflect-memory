# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for port M5 — commit_verifier extracts hex commit refs from a
# ABOUTME: learning body and verifies each against the real local repo via git cat-file, so a
# ABOUTME: fabricated sha is flagged unverified while a genuine repo sha is confirmed verified.
"""M5 commit-reference verification proof (capture/write-time integrity primitive).

Port M5 is a CAPTURE port, NOT a retrieval port. The real diff (commit
8c77718a, "verify commit refs in learnings before persistence") adds
``plugins/reflect/scripts/commit_verifier.py`` and wires it into
``output_generator.create_knowledge_note`` so that, BEFORE a learning is
persisted, every cited commit hash is checked against the project repo. A note
where EVERY cited ref is fabricated is rejected; surviving notes record
``unverified_refs`` in frontmatter so recall can downrank/warn. ``recall.py``
contains no reference to commit_verifier — the behaviour executes strictly
upstream of indexing, so the strongest OBSERVABLE invariant lives in the real
module, driven directly (no mock, no stub, no LLM).

The supplied hypothesis was correct in shape; this proof pins it against the
real code: extraction requires at least one DIGIT in the candidate (filtering
hex-shaped English words), and verification uses ``git cat-file -e
<sha>^{commit}`` in ``repo_dir``.

INVARIANT (seeds + the repo_dir knob fully determine each outcome — no LLM runs
in the assertion; git's object database is the oracle):

  1. EXTRACT: a body citing a real 8-hex repo sha (digits present) and a
     fabricated 12-hex sha (digits present) yields BOTH as candidate refs,
     while a hex-shaped English word with no digit ("deadbeef" -> filtered by
     the digit rule) is NOT extracted. Pure extraction, deterministic regex.

  2. VERIFY (port ON, repo_dir = the real reflect repo): ``verify_refs`` marks
     the genuine repo sha ``verified`` and the fabricated sha ``unverified``;
     the report is ``checked=True``. This is M5's whole reason to exist —
     git cat-file distinguishes the hallucination from the real citation.

  3. KNOB FLIP / FALSIFIABLE (port OFF, repo_dir = a non-repo tmp dir): the
     SAME body produces ``checked=False`` and flags NOTHING — the real sha is
     no longer "verified" and the bogus sha is no longer "unverified". This
     proves the verdict in (2) is caused by the git-backed verification against
     a real repo, not by text luck: absence of a repo means absence of
     evidence, and M5 refuses to call anything a hallucination without it.

  4. all_unverified gate: a body citing ONLY fabricated shas (the
     reject-the-note condition the writer keys on) reports ``all_unverified``
     True against the real repo, and False once a genuine sha is added — the
     exact boolean ``create_knowledge_note`` uses to reject a fully-hallucinated
     note.

Falsifiability: if verification were broken (always-verify), assertion 2 would
FAIL (bogus sha reported verified) and assertion 4 would FAIL. If the digit
filter were dropped, assertion 1 would FAIL ("deadbeef" extracted). If the
non-repo guard were dropped, assertion 3 would show the same verdict ON and OFF
and the proof would be vacuous.

Surface used: capture (real commit_verifier module), not the behavioral_kb
retrieval fixture — see above for why recall is the wrong surface for this port.
No torch model is loaded; this proof is fast.
