"""C3 graph-maintenance post-delete sweep proof.

Port C3 is a CONSOLIDATION port (surface=consolidation). It extends
``plugins/reflect/scripts/graphml_repair.py`` with a ``--maintain`` mode and
wires it into the drain hook to run once per N drains. The sweep is a pure
*structural* rewrite of the local GraphRAG graphml — no embedding model, no LLM,
no network — so it is driven here directly via the REAL module (no mock of the
thing under test). The retrieval/ranking surface is untouched (this runs at
capture/consolidation time, not query time), so the behavioral_kb retrieval
fixture is the wrong surface and is deliberately not used. All state is isolated
to a tmp dir; the only inputs are a graphml string and the module, so the seed
fully determines the verdict — there is nothing for an LLM to decide.

The graphml schema mirrors nano-graphrag's on-disk cache (see
``reflect-kb/tests/test_typed_links_engine.py``): node ids are quote-wrapped,
nodes carry an ``entity_type`` (d0) and a ``source_id`` (learning-ref chunk ids,
joined with ``<SEP>``) data attr, edges carry a ``weight``. A learning being
deleted/superseded drops its chunk id out of those source_id lists, leaving:
  * orphan entities — a node with no remaining learning refs AND no edges;
  * stale cooccurrence edges — an edge pointing at a node that no longer exists;
  * nodes that lost their only neighbour once a stale edge was pruned but still
    carry a learning ref (must be relinked to a co-referencing node).

Invariants (each arm's graphml + the module fully determine the verdict — no LLM):

  A. ORPHAN-ENTITY COUNT GOES TO 0. A graph with a KNOWN orphan entity (a node
     whose source_id is empty and which has no edges) has zero orphan entities
     after ``maintain`` — the acceptance criterion. The non-orphan nodes survive.

  B. STALE COOCCURRENCE EDGE IS PRUNED. An edge whose endpoint references a node
     that does not exist in the graph (a dangling endpoint left after the entity
     was deleted) is removed; live edges are kept. This is decisive: if stale
     edges survived, the dangling endpoint would still be reachable.

  C. NODE THAT LOST NEIGHBOURS IS RELINKED. A node that still carries a learning
     ref but became isolated after the stale-edge prune is relinked to a node it
     co-occurs with (shares a source_id chunk) — its cooccurrence signal is
     topped back up rather than stranded. The new edge connects two real,
     surviving, co-referencing nodes (not an arbitrary pair).

  D. IDEMPOTENT ON A CLEAN GRAPH. Running ``maintain`` on an already-clean graph
     (no orphans, no dangling edges, no isolated-with-refs nodes) reports a
     pure no-op (all-zero stats) and leaves the file byte-for-byte unchanged.
     This is the falsifiable arm: a sweep that mutated indiscriminately would
     change the clean file and the byte-equality assertion would FAIL.

  E. RESULT STILL VALIDATES. After the mutate+rewrite the graphml still parses
     (``is_valid`` is True) — the sweep never ships a broken file.

Falsifiability: if the orphan survived, arm A fails. If the stale edge survived,
arm B's count is non-zero and fails. If the isolated node were left stranded,
arm C finds no relink edge and FAILS. If the sweep were not idempotent, arm D's
byte-equality assertion FAILS. The maintain pass is exercised through the real
module's public ``maintain`` / ``maintain_tree`` entry points.
