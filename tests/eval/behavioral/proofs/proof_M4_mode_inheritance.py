# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for port M4 — mode_loader resolves a pluggable mode by overlaying a
# ABOUTME: child mode onto its single named parent (one level only), and REFLECT_MODE switches it.
"""M4 pluggable-mode inheritance proof (capture/signal port, NOT a retrieval port).

Port M4 lives in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/mode_loader.py`` (commit 7f985102),
a stdlib-only module that the reflect drain/signal layer reads its taxonomy and
prompt templates from. ``recall.py`` has NO reference to it — the mode is
resolved entirely at capture/drain time, so the behavioral_kb retrieval fixture
is the WRONG surface here (there is nothing to rank; the invariant is "what does
the resolved mode config contain"). This proof drives the REAL module directly
(no mock, no stub, no torch — fast). No LLM runs in any assertion: ``load_mode``
and ``deep_merge`` are pure, deterministic dict operations over JSON files.

The supplied hypothesis named ``recall.py`` / ``DEFAULT_MODE`` as the surface;
the real diff puts the surface in ``mode_loader.py`` (``REFLECT_MODE`` env,
``REFLECT_MODES_DIR`` env, ``DEFAULT_MODE="engineering"``, ``load_mode`` +
``deep_merge`` + ``parse_inheritance``). The invariant is corrected to the real
code:

  INHERITANCE is SINGLE LEVEL via ``parent--override`` file naming. Loading
  ``parent--override`` deep-merges ``override.json`` on top of ``parent.json``;
  the override replaces scalars/lists it declares and inherits everything it
  does not. ``a--b--c`` (two levels) is a hard error. Because the parent is
  loaded as a *simple* mode (it does not itself re-resolve a grandparent), a key
  that lives only in a grandparent file does NOT reach the leaf unless the
  direct parent re-declares it.

ARMS (each seeds its OWN fresh modes dir + clears the module mode cache, so no
state leaks between arms):

  1. INHERIT + OVERRIDE (port ON): ``engineering--zh`` inherits the parent's
     ``name`` / ``learning_types`` (keys it does NOT declare) AND overrides
     ``locale`` (the one key it declares: en -> zh). This is the shipped
     locale-variant shape: a one-key child file produces a full merged mode.

  2. EXACTLY ONE LEVEL (falsifiable guard): ``parse_inheritance("a--b--c")``
     raises ``ModeError`` — more than one ``--`` is rejected, matching the
     claude-mem single-level invariant. A bare ``parent--override`` (one ``--``)
     does not raise.

  3. GRANDPARENT NOT PULLED THROUGH (decisive single-level test): a key that
     exists ONLY in a grandparent file is ABSENT from a leaf whose direct parent
     does not re-declare it — then PRESENT once the direct parent re-declares it.
     This is the contrast that proves inheritance is one level, not transitive:
     if the loader chained grandparents, the grandparent-only key would leak in.

  4. REFLECT_MODE SWITCHES THE RESOLVED CONFIG (the env knob from the diff):
     with ``REFLECT_MODE=engineering`` the resolved locale is ``en`` and the
     auto-derived LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS directive is empty; flipping
     ``REFLECT_MODE=engineering--zh`` resolves locale ``zh`` and a non-empty
     directive — same files, the env var alone changes the resolved config.
     This proves the PORT (env-driven resolution) caused the difference.

Falsifiability: if M4 were absent or merge were broken, (1) would drop the
inherited parent keys; if multi-level were allowed, (2) would not raise and (3)'s
grandparent key would leak through; if ``REFLECT_MODE`` were ignored, (4) would
return the same config for both values.

Surface used: signal (real mode_loader module), not the behavioral_kb retrieval
fixture — see above. No torch model is loaded; this proof is fast.
