"""A6 branch-aware capture & isolation proof.

Invariant: with two worktrees of the SAME project — branch ``feat/auth`` and
branch ``feat/payment`` — each branch's learnings live in its own sub-shard
(``<root>/shards/<project>/branches/<branch>/``). A default recall run from
worktree A (``RECALL_BRANCH=feat/auth``) returns A's learning and NOT B's
(clean per-worktree isolation — the symptom A6 fixes is "working on feat/A and
getting injected learnings from feat/B"), while the SAME query run with
``--all-branches`` surfaces B's learning too (cross-branch union pooled at the
project-level shard). Shard layout + the current branch + the --all-branches
flag fully determine inclusion/exclusion; no LLM participates in the assertion.

Like the R15 proof, this deliberately does NOT use the shared `behavioral_kb`
fixture: that fixture pins $GLOBAL_LEARNINGS_PATH to one KB, which (by the
explicit-override precedence) bypasses shard resolution entirely. Instead it
builds real branch sub-shards under a sandboxed RECALL_LEARNINGS_ROOT and
drives recall.py via CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (project detection) + RECALL_BRANCH
(branch detection) with $GLOBAL_LEARNINGS_PATH UNSET — exactly the runtime
shape the SessionStart hook hits inside a worktree.

Falsifiability: if branch-awareness were absent (A6 reverted to plain R15, one
shard per project), BOTH branches' learnings would pool into the single project
shard, so the default scope-A recall would return B's learning and the
isolation assertion would FAIL. If --all-branches were ignored (stuck on the
branch sub-shard), the union recall would miss B and the union assertion would
FAIL.
