"""R13 auto-skill-refresh trigger proof.

Port R13 (bead agents-in-a-box-kdo.39) is a STORAGE/SIGNAL port, not a
file-engine recall port. Its behaviour lives entirely in
``plugins/reflect/scripts/`` (``reflect_cascade.py``, ``reflect_db.py``,
``skill_index.py``) — so this proof drives those real modules against an
on-disk ``reflect_db`` sqlite store directly. No LLM, no torch model, no vector
engine is involved: the seeds plus the literal revision-action objects fully
determine every asserted outcome. (In production the drain's LLM only *chooses*
which CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE action to emit; here we hand the executor the actions
verbatim, so the assertions test the executor's deterministic state transitions
and the deterministic stdlib token-overlap match, never an LLM decision.)

The TRUE invariant (corrected against the real diff at db2fb687 —
``feat(reflect): auto-flag and refresh skills when backing learnings change``):

When ``execute_revision_actions`` applies an UPDATE or DELETE to a learning, it
back-reacts on the promoted-skills index via ``trigger_skill_refreshes``:

  STALENESS CONDITION (the trigger predicate, deterministic, stdlib-only):
    a skill is "backed by" the revised learning when one of its tags either
    EQUALS the learning's category (case-insensitive) OR has ALL its content
    tokens present in the learning's title. ``skills_backing_learning`` computes
    this with ``_content_tokens`` (lowercased, stopwords dropped).

  WHEN THE CONDITION HOLDS (refresh fires):
    * every backing skill is flagged ``is_stale = 1`` in reflect.db
      (``mark_skills_stale``), and
    * exactly one ``skill_refresh`` task per skill is appended to
      ``pending_reflections.jsonl`` (``enqueue_skill_refresh``), and
    * the summary reports ``skills_marked_stale`` / ``refreshes_queued`` counts.

  WHEN THE CONDITION DOES NOT HOLD (refresh skipped — the control):
    * a skill with NO tag overlap and NO category match is left ``is_stale = 0``
      and NO ``skill_refresh`` task is queued for it.

  DOWNSTREAM OBSERVABLE (why staleness matters):
    ``skill_index.match_skills`` excludes ``is_stale`` rows — so a skill that
    matched a query BEFORE the revision stops matching AFTER it (it can no
    longer win the R11 inject tier with possibly-drifted guidance), while a
    non-stale control skill that matches the same query keeps matching.

  CLEARING (the refresh completing):
    re-``upsert_skill`` with a NEW mtime (the SKILL.md was actually
    regenerated/edited) clears ``is_stale``; re-upserting the SAME mtime (a
    blind rebuild pass) PRESERVES the flag — so a stale skill stays stale until
    its content really changes.

  DEDUP:
    a second revision touching the same skill does NOT queue a second
    ``skill_refresh`` task (``_skill_refresh_already_queued``).

Why no LLM: the staleness predicate is pure stdlib token overlap; the queue
file is a literal JSONL append; ``match_skills`` is deterministic token scoring;
the clearing rule is a CASE on mtime equality. The seeds (learning title +
category, skill tags + mtime) and the literal action objects fully determine the
``is_stale`` column, the queued tasks, the match results, and the clear/preserve
outcome. Nothing asserted here was decided by a model.

Falsifiability: if the trigger never fired, Arm 1's in-scope skill would stay
``is_stale = 0`` and queue nothing. If the predicate ignored tag/category scope,
Arm 1's out-of-scope control skill would ALSO be flagged. If ``match_skills``
did not exclude stale rows, Arm 2's post-revision match would still return the
flagged skill. If ``upsert_skill`` cleared on every upsert, Arm 3's same-mtime
re-upsert would clear the flag. If dedup were absent, Arm 4 would queue two
tasks. Each arm seeds its OWN fresh DB (no cross-arm state sharing).
