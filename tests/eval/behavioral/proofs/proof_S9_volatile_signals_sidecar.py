"""S9 volatile-signals-out-of-frontmatter proof.

Port S9 is a STORAGE port (surface=storage). Corrected against the real diff at
c9787fd2 (`feat(reflect): move volatile ranking signals into reflect.db sidecar
(S9)`), the true invariant lives in the reflect plugin's ``reflect_db.py`` — NOT
in recall.py — so there is no recall ranking knob and NO torch engine / LLM in
the assertion. We drive the REAL ``reflect_db`` module and the REAL note writer
``output_generator.create_knowledge_note`` directly.

The port moves the churning ranking signals (importance, maturity, recall_count,
helpful_count, ignored_count, stale_count, last_recalled_at) out of git-tracked
note markdown and into a ``learning_signals`` sidecar table inside reflect.db.
After a note is written its bytes are immutable: per-query recall bumps land only
in the DB, so team-shared knowledge notes produce clean git diffs and never
merge-conflict on telemetry.

Invariant (each arm seeds its own fresh state; the seed + the real module fully
determine the verdict — nothing here is decided by an LLM):

  Arm 1 — PER-QUERY BUMPS NEVER TOUCH MARKDOWN (decisive, with control).
     A real knowledge note is written to disk via the production
     ``create_knowledge_note`` writer; its exact bytes and mtime are captured.
     The learning is registered in reflect.db, then the REAL per-query recall
     path ``add_recall_event`` is fired three times. After the bumps:
       (a) the note file's bytes are byte-identical to the pre-bump capture
           and its mtime is unchanged — markdown was never rewritten;
       (b) NO volatile key (importance/maturity/recall_count/...) ever appears
           in the note's top-level frontmatter;
       (c) the sidecar row DID move: learning_signals.recall_count == 3 and
           last_recalled_at is populated — i.e. the telemetry the markdown did
           NOT absorb is provably tracked in its separate store.
     Control (proves (a)/(b) are not vacuous): a DURABLE field — the note
     ``title`` — IS present in frontmatter and equals what we wrote.

  Arm 2 — WRITE-TIME STRIP GUARD IS DECISIVE (knob-style on/off).
     ``strip_volatile_signal_fields`` is the write-time guard note writers apply
     before persisting markdown. Fed a frontmatter dict carrying BOTH durable
     fields (title, category, confidence_num) AND every member of
     VOLATILE_SIGNAL_FIELDS, it returns a copy where:
       - every volatile key is DROPPED (the "off" side: these never reach
         markdown), AND
       - every durable key passes through with its value intact (the "on"
         side: semantic content is untouched).
     The control is the identity case: a frontmatter with ONLY durable fields is
     returned unchanged. Toggling whether a key is in VOLATILE_SIGNAL_FIELDS is
     exactly what flips whether it survives — proving the guard owns the drop,
     not some incidental schema loss.

  Arm 3 — MISSING SIDECAR ROW READS AS DEFAULTS, not a frontmatter fallback.
     ``get_learning_signals`` for a learning whose row was never bumped returns
     the ByteRover defaults (importance 50, maturity 'draft', zero counters) —
     the read path is the sidecar, so a never-recalled learning is indistinguish-
     able from a missing row and never reaches into note markdown for signals.

Falsifiability: if a per-query bump rewrote the note (pre-S9 frontmatter
counters), arm 1(a) would FAIL on changed bytes/mtime. If any volatile key
leaked into frontmatter, arm 1(b) FAILS. If the bump didn't reach the sidecar,
arm 1(c)'s recall_count==3 FAILS. If the strip guard kept a volatile key or
dropped a durable one, arm 2 FAILS. If the read path fell back to markdown
instead of DB defaults, arm 3 FAILS.
