"""S7 delta retain / chunk-hash dedup proof.

Port S7 is a STORAGE/CAPTURE port: it acts at drain (ingest) time inside the
cascade, before any LLM or KB write. recall.py never sees a "chunk hash" flag,
so the port's behaviour is not directly observable as a recall ranking knob.
Per the proof guide for storage ports, this proof asserts the stored SHAPE (the
``chunk_hashes`` dedup table + its TTL) AND the closest observable retrieval
consequence: re-draining the SAME transcript must not duplicate the learning in
the KB, so a recall query keeps returning a SINGLE copy of it rather than two.

Invariant (three linked assertions, seeds + flags fully determine each — no LLM
in the assertion):

  1. FIRST drain of a signal-bearing transcript: cascade.prepare() returns
     action=reflect with chunks_skipped=0 — the chunk is new, it gets reflected,
     and its hash is recorded in chunk_hashes. The learning the slice would
     produce is seeded into the real hermetic KB and a recall for it returns
     exactly ONE hit.

  2. RE-DRAIN of the byte-identical transcript: cascade.prepare() returns
     action=skip / reason=dup-chunk-hash with chunks_skipped == chunks_total —
     i.e. 0 NEW chunks => 0 new learnings (the first acceptance bullet). Because
     the re-drain produces nothing, NO second copy of the learning is written,
     so the SAME recall query STILL returns exactly one hit (not a duplicated
     pair). This is the observable retrieval consequence of the dedup.

  3. TTL (the second acceptance bullet): after the chunk-hash rows are aged past
     the retention window and pruned, prepare() on the identical transcript
     reflects AGAIN (chunks_skipped=0) — a stale dedup entry can never wedge a
     chunk out of re-reflection forever.

Falsifiability: if chunk-hash dedup were absent, the re-drain in (2) would
reflect the transcript again (action=reflect, chunks_skipped=0), a second
identical learning would land in the KB, and a recall would surface the
DUPLICATE — assertion (2) would FAIL. If the TTL were absent (hashes kept
forever), the aged-and-pruned re-run in (3) would still skip and assertion (3)
would FAIL.
