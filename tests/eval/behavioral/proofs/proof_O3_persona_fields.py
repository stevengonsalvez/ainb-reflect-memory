"""O3 persona/preference-fields proof.

Port O3 (bead agents-in-a-box-kdo.48, Hindsight banks.disposition persona
object) is a STORAGE/retrieval port. It adds the structured-fields layer ON TOP
of the O1 observations layer: where an O1 observation is a free-text aggregate
statement ("this team generally prefers TDD"), an O3 persona field is the
DISTILLED typed answer (testing_style='TDD') keyed by (project_id, field_name)
in the real ``project_persona`` table in ``reflect_db``. Fields are AGGREGATED
from O1 observations — never hand-authored — and confidence is a DETERMINISTIC
function of the count of distinct source observations cited
(reflect_db.persona_confidence). The drain's second pass emits persona
CREATE/UPDATE actions; the executor under test is
``reflect_cascade.execute_persona_actions``.

This proof drives those real modules against an on-disk ``reflect.db`` + tmp
state dir directly. No LLM, no torch model, no vector engine is on the path: the
seeds plus the literal persona-action objects fully determine every asserted
outcome. (In production the drain's LLM only *chooses* which CREATE/UPDATE
action to emit; here we hand the executor the actions verbatim, so the
assertions test the executor's deterministic aggregation + the deterministic
confidence curve over the evidence count, never an LLM decision.)

The TRUE invariant:

``execute_persona_actions`` distils persona CREATE/UPDATE actions into a typed
``project_persona`` field whose confidence is a deterministic function of the
distinct source-observation evidence, and the open-domain field lookup answers a
matching query directly:

  AGGREGATION + CONFIDENCE RISE (decisive): ~10 'prefer TDD' actions, each
    citing a DISTINCT source observation, fold into ONE testing_style row (not
    10 siblings). source_observation_ids accumulates every distinct id and
    confidence rises monotonically with the evidence count, crossing 0.8 at ~10
    distinct sources. proof: confidence = min(1, n/12), so n=10 -> 0.833 > 0.8.

  THIN/CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE STAYS BELOW THRESHOLD (control): a field backed by
    only 1-2 distinct sources does NOT cross 0.8, so the open-domain lookup
    refuses to answer from it — the agent does not get a confident disposition
    out of thin evidence.

  UPDATE FOLDS, NO DUP ROW + IDEMPOTENT: an UPDATE for the same field folds new
    evidence into the SAME (project_id, field_name) row — exactly one row
    survives, confidence is RECOMPUTED from the grown distinct count, and
    re-citing only already-recorded ids cannot inflate confidence past the real
    distinct evidence.

  OPEN-DOMAIN LOOKUP ANSWERS DIRECTLY (the O3 retrieval knob): for an
    open-domain query naming the field ('what testing style do we use?'),
    ``recall_persona_field`` returns the high-confidence persona value directly;
    a closed-domain query ('how do I fix the flaky test?') and an open-domain
    query that names a DIFFERENT (thin) field both return None — the caller then
    falls through to normal recall.

Why no LLM: every asserted value is a deterministic function of the seeds and
the literal action dicts. The confidence is integer-count arithmetic
(min(1, n/SATURATION)); the dedup of evidence ids is set membership; the field
match is a substring test of the field_name tokens against the lowered query;
the threshold gate is a numeric comparison. Nothing asserted here was decided by
a model.

Falsifiability: if CREATE/UPDATE spawned siblings instead of folding, the row
count would be > 1 and confidence would be stuck at the seed value. If
confidence did not rise with evidence, the ~10-source field would stay below 0.8
and the lookup would refuse. If the threshold gate were absent, the thin
1-2-source field would answer the open-domain query. If a re-cite of known ids
inflated evidence, the idempotent re-run would bump confidence. If the lookup
ignored open-domainness or field-name matching, the closed-domain / wrong-field
queries would wrongly return a value. Each arm builds its OWN fresh on-disk DB +
state dir (no cross-arm contamination).
