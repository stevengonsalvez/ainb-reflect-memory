"""S5 belief-revision-on-ingest proof.

Port S5 (bead agents-in-a-box-kdo.8) is a STORAGE/STATE port. Its behaviour lives
in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/reflect_cascade.py`` — NOT in the file-engine recall
pipeline — so this proof drives the real module + the real on-disk
``reflect_db`` sqlite store directly. No LLM, no torch model, no vector engine is
involved: the seeds plus the literal action objects fully determine every
asserted outcome. (The drain LLM only *chooses* which action to emit in
production; here we hand the executor the actions verbatim, so the assertions
test the executor's deterministic state transitions, never an LLM decision.)

The TRUE invariant (corrected against the real diff — the hypothesis guessed
``is_latest``/``superseded_by``, but S5's executor does NOT touch those columns):

  reflect_cascade.execute_revision_actions applies the structured
  CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE action contract to the learnings DB such that:

  1. UPDATE-SUPERSEDES-AS-EVIDENCE: an UPDATE of an existing learning does NOT
     write a duplicate note. It merges the new transcript as evidence via
     reflect_db.add_learning_proof — proof_count increments (1 -> 2), the new
     source id is appended to source_memory_ids, and an S6 history snapshot of
     the PRIOR form is recorded. The single-proof belief as-first-written is
     thereby superseded by a strengthened, two-proof belief; the row count does
     NOT grow. summary['updated'] == 1.

  2. DELETE-TOMBSTONES (non-destructive): a DELETE flips status to 'reverted'
     with the action's reason, the row PERSISTS (ledger keeps it so "why was
     this retired?" stays answerable), and — because 'reverted' is in
     reflect_cascade._RETIRED_STATUSES — the tombstoned belief is NO LONGER
     surfaced by recall_related_learnings as a revision candidate, while a live
     CREATE'd sibling with the same topic IS. summary['deleted'] == 1.

  3. KNOB / FALSIFIABLE CONTROL — idempotency by source id: re-running the SAME
     UPDATE with the SAME source_memory_id is an idempotent no-op
     (add_learning_proof returns False). proof_count stays at 2, no second
     history snapshot for that source, summary['skipped'] == 1 and
     summary['updated'] == 0. This pins that the supersession-as-evidence is
     driven by the structured action + source identity, NOT by text luck or a
     blind "bump on every call" — flipping the source id back to a NEW one DOES
     bump again (knob OFF -> ON), proving the executor caused the difference.

Falsifiability: if the UPDATE path were the old "always CREATE" behaviour,
assertion 1 would see a SECOND row and proof_count still 1. If DELETE were a
hard delete (Hindsight's shape), assertion 2's get_learning would return None
instead of a reverted row. If DELETE did not retire to a _RETIRED_STATUS,
recall_related_learnings would still surface the tombstoned belief. If the
executor bumped blindly, assertion 3's idempotent re-run would inflate
proof_count to 3.
