# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for S10 — the drain write-validate-retry loop drives a

"""S10 write-validate-retry loop proof (storage/capture port, NOT retrieval).

Port S10 lives in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/reflect_cascade.py``
(``write_validate_retry`` + ``validate_drain_output`` + ``DrainOutput`` /
``DrainResult``), the ByteRover ``curate-session.ts`` correct-html loop
(MAX_ATTEMPTS=4) re-shaped for the reflect drain: after the drain LLM writes a
learning, its STRUCTURE is validated (required frontmatter fields present + the
``.entities.yaml`` sidecar valid via the EXISTING ``validate_sidecar.validate``
+ the sidecar's entity claims actually referenced in the body). On a structural
failure the writer is re-prompted with the errors inlined and tries again,
BOUNDED at 3 attempts; a note that never validates is still written, flagged
``validated: false``, so a malformed learning self-heals at write time instead
of polluting the corpus. ``recall.py`` and the GraphRAG engine never see this —
the signal is produced entirely at *capture/write* time — so the behavioral_kb
retrieval fixture is the wrong surface (there is nothing to rank).

The LOOP is the unit under test, NOT the LLM. The drain write step is abstracted
behind a callable (``writer(errors) -> DrainOutput``); this proof injects a
DETERMINISTIC fake writer that emits malformed output the first K times then
valid output — so NO LLM runs in any assertion. ``validate_drain_output`` is a
pure YAML/markdown linter that REUSES the shipped ``validate_sidecar`` validator
(the spec's "do not duplicate the validator" rule).

INVARIANTS (the fake writer's malformed-count K and the attempt budget fully
determine each outcome — no LLM in the assertion):

  A. CLEAN FIRST WRITE accepts at attempt 1. A writer whose very first output is
     structurally valid is accepted with attempts=1, validated=True, and the
     loop never re-invokes it (the control: a well-behaved writer pays no retry).

  B. ONE MALFORMED THEN VALID regenerates once then accepts. K=1: the 1st output
     fails validation, the writer is re-invoked WITH the errors inlined, the 2nd
     output validates -> attempts=2, validated=True. The acceptance criterion
     "a malformed learning regenerates once then accepts" + "telemetry tracks
     attempt count". The proof also asserts the re-prompt actually carried the
     prior attempt's errors (the self-heal feedback channel), and that the 1st
     call saw an EMPTY error list (nothing to inline yet).

  C. ACCEPT AS SOON AS VALID — the loop stops at the first valid attempt, it does
     NOT spend the whole budget. K=2 under a budget of 3 -> attempts=3 (valid on
     the 3rd, the last allowed); K=1 under the default budget -> attempts=2, not
     3. The recorded attempt count equals the attempt that first validated.

  D. ALWAYS-MALFORMED BAILS AT EXACTLY 3 with validated=False. A writer that is
     never valid is invoked EXACTLY max_attempts (3) times — not 2, not 4 — and
     the loop gives up: validated=False, attempts=3, errors carries the last
     attempt's failures, and the note body is STILL returned (signal is never
     dropped — it is quarantined via the flag, not discarded).

  E. THE BUDGET IS A KNOB (falsifiable, proves the loop owns the bound). The SAME
     always-malformed writer under max_attempts=2 is invoked exactly 2 times and
     bails (validated=False, attempts=2); under max_attempts=5 it is invoked
     exactly 5 times. Same seed, different knob, different invocation count and
     attempt total -> the bound is the LOOP's doing, not an artifact of the
     writer.

  F. VALIDATION REUSES THE REAL SIDECAR VALIDATOR (decisive, proves it is not a
     stub gate). An output whose ONLY defect is a structurally-broken sidecar
     (entity missing required keys) is rejected, and the surfaced error is the
     one ``validate_sidecar.validate`` emits, prefixed ``sidecar:`` — flipping
     that sidecar to a valid one (nothing else changed) clears the rejection and
     the loop accepts at attempt 1. So the loop's accept/reject is owned by the
     shipped validator, not incidental.

Falsifiability: if the loop did not retry, (B)/(C) would report attempts=1 and a
validated=False on the first malformed output. If it never bounded, (D)/(E)
would loop forever (or invoke != max_attempts). If it dropped the note on
give-up, (D)'s body assertion would fail. If validation were a stub that always
passed, (D) would wrongly accept and (F)'s sidecar-flip would not change the
verdict.

Surface used: capture/write (real reflect_cascade loop + real validate_sidecar),
not the behavioral_kb retrieval fixture — see above. No torch model is loaded;
fast.
