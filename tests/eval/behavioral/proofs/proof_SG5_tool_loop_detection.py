"""SG5 tool-loop detection proof (capture/signal port, NOT a retrieval port).

Port SG5 lives in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/loop_detector.py`` (commit b8fb45e5),
a stdlib-only module that the PostToolUse hook calls before its failure check.
``recall.py`` has NO reference to it — the signal is produced entirely at capture
time. So the behavioral_kb retrieval fixture is the WRONG surface here: there is
nothing to rank, the invariant is "did the detector fire on the loop pattern".
This proof drives the REAL module directly (no mock, no stub, no torch — fast).

The supplied hypothesis said ``record_call`` returns a "flag boolean". The real
diff returns ``Optional[LoopHit]`` — a dict ``{"kind","tool","count"}`` on
detection, else ``None``. The invariant is corrected against the real code:

  detector constants (the port's knobs): WINDOW=10, REPEAT_N=3, OSC_CYCLES=2.

INVARIANT (seeds + the threshold knobs fully determine each outcome — no LLM
runs in the assertion; ``record_call`` is a pure deterministic state machine):

  1. BENIGN (no fire): a varied sequence of distinct (tool, input) pairs never
     trips the window — every call returns ``None``. This is the control: a
     normally-progressing agent produces no loop signal.

  2. REPEAT fires (port ON): the SAME (session, tool, arg-hash) appearing
     REPEAT_N=3 times consecutively returns a LoopHit with kind="repeat". The
     first two identical calls return None; only the 3rd — crossing the
     threshold — fires. This pins the threshold, not mere "saw it twice".

  3. ARG-HASH DISCRIMINATION (falsifiable knob): three calls to the SAME tool
     with DIFFERENT inputs do NOT fire. The loop is keyed on (tool, arg_hash),
     so changing the argument breaks the repeat. This proves the detector keys
     on input identity (the port's design), not on tool name alone — if it
     keyed on tool only, this control would false-positive.

  4. OSCILLATION fires (port ON): an A,B,A,B tail (OSC_CYCLES=2 full cycles,
     A != B) returns a LoopHit with kind="oscillation" naming both tools. A
     sub-threshold A,B,A (only 3 calls) does NOT fire.

  5. WINDOW RESET (port ON): after a detection the window is cleared, so one
     stuck stretch arms ONCE — the call immediately after a hit returns None,
     and it takes a fresh REPEAT_N run to re-arm. (Without this the hook would
     arm on every subsequent identical call.)

Falsifiability: if SG5 were absent or the thresholds wrong, (2)/(4) would return
None (no signal), and (1)/(3) would have nothing to contrast against. If the
detector keyed on tool-name only, (3) would false-fire. If reset were dropped,
(5)'s "immediately after a hit returns None" assertion would fail.

Surface used: signal (real loop_detector module), not the behavioral_kb
retrieval fixture — see above. No torch model is loaded; this proof is fast.
