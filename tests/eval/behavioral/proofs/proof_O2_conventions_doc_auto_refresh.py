"""O2 auto-refreshing conventions-doc proof.

Port O2 (bead agents-in-a-box-kdo.36) is a STORAGE port, not a file-engine
recall port. Its behaviour lives entirely in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/``
(``reflect_cascade.py``, ``conventions_generator.py``, ``reflect_db.py``) — so
this proof drives those real modules against an on-disk ``reflect.db`` sqlite
store + a tmp state dir directly. No LLM, no torch model, no vector engine is
involved: the seeds plus the literal observation-action objects fully determine
every asserted outcome. (In production the drain's LLM only *chooses* which
CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE observation action to emit; here we hand the executor the
actions verbatim, so the assertions test the executor's deterministic state
transitions and the deterministic stdlib markdown render, never an LLM
decision.)

The TRUE invariant (corrected against the real diff at 6b3a343c —
``feat(reflect): auto-refreshing per-project conventions doc (O2)``):

When ``execute_observation_actions`` applies a CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE to an
observation, it back-reacts on the conventions layer via
``trigger_conventions_refresh`` -> ``conventions_generator.refresh_for_scope``:

  REFRESH CONDITION (the trigger predicate, deterministic, stdlib-only):
    a registered ``conventions_docs`` row "covers" a touched scope when that
    scope appears in the row's ``scope_tags`` OR equals its ``project_id``
    (``scope='global'`` covers EVERY row). Every covered doc is regenerated.

  WHEN THE CONDITION HOLDS (refresh fires):
    * the doc is re-rendered as deterministic markdown over the LIVE
      observations table and re-materialized on disk at ``doc_path``;
    * ``upsert_conventions_doc`` moves ``last_refreshed_at`` to now and clears
      the stored staleness flag;
    * the summary reports ``conventions_refreshed`` >= 1.
    Because regeneration is deterministic markdown (no LLM on the path), it
    happens INLINE — unlike R13 skill refreshes which queue a drain task.

  WHEN THE CONDITION DOES NOT HOLD (refresh skipped — the control):
    * a registered doc whose scope was NOT touched keeps its old body and its
      old ``last_refreshed_at`` (it is left out of the regeneration);
    * a no-op / malformed action batch (no scope touched at all) reports
      ``conventions_refreshed == 0`` and moves nothing.

  CONTENT REFLECTS THE CHANGE (why regeneration matters):
    a CREATE puts its convention text into the regenerated body; an UPDATE
    bumps the rendered evidence count; a DELETE/retire drops the retired
    convention out of the body — the doc is a live digest of the table, not a
    frozen snapshot.

Why no LLM: the refresh predicate is pure scope-set membership; the doc body is
``render_conventions_md`` — a literal f-string over the observations rows; the
``last_refreshed_at`` move and flag-clear are a deterministic SQL upsert. The
seeds (observation content / category / scope, the registered doc's scope_tags)
plus the literal action objects fully determine the regenerated body, the
refreshed-count, and which docs move. Nothing asserted here was decided by a
model.

Falsifiability: if the trigger never fired, Arm 1's in-scope doc body would not
gain the new convention and its ``last_refreshed_at`` would not move, and
``conventions_refreshed`` would be 0. If the predicate ignored scope, Arm 1's
out-of-scope control doc would ALSO regenerate. If regeneration read a stale
cache instead of the live table, Arm 2's evidence count would not rise and the
retired convention would survive in Arm 3's body. If a no-op batch still
refreshed, Arm 4 would move the timestamp. Each arm seeds its OWN fresh DB +
state dir (no cross-arm contamination).
