"""C1 per-ingest semantic-dedup adjudication proof.

Port C1 (bead agents-in-a-box-kdo.22) is a STORAGE/STATE port. Its behaviour
lives in ``plugins/reflect/scripts/reflect_cascade.py`` — the CREATE arm of
``execute_revision_actions`` now first probes the existing learnings for a
semantic twin (``find_semantic_twin``) by embedding cosine BEFORE the row is
written. At/above the dedup threshold (default 0.97; env
``REFLECT_DEDUP_THRESHOLD`` or ``[cascade].dedup_threshold``; ``>= 1.0``
disables) the CREATE does NOT land: it is held under ``adjudications`` with a
focused 'merge?' question and ``needs_adjudication`` is incremented. A
semantically-distinct CREATE has no twin and lands a real new row.

This proof drives the real module + the real on-disk ``reflect_db`` directly,
and — crucially — the cosine that decides 'twin or not' is computed by the REAL
``reflect embed`` SUBPROCESS into ``all-mpnet-base-v2`` (the exact model
nano-graphrag indexes chunks with, so the dedup similarity lives in the index's
own embedding space). Nothing in C1's path is replaced: ``find_semantic_twin``
issues its real non-retired-candidate DB query, shells out to the real
``reflect embed`` for vectors, computes its real ``_cosine``, and applies the
real threshold; the executor makes the real hold-or-land decision. The only
test wiring is pointing ``_find_reflect_cli`` at the eval-venv ``reflect``
binary (the same full-stack CLI the recall proofs use) so the subprocess
resolves.

No LLM participates in any assertion — the seeds, the literal CREATE actions,
the real model's deterministic vectors, and the 0.97 floor fully determine
every outcome. (The drain LLM only *answers* an adjudication in production;
here we never need it, because the assertions test whether the row LANDED or was
HELD — a pure storage state the executor decides, not an LLM verdict.)

The TRUE invariant (corrected against the real diff in 006d4dd3):

  reflect_cascade.execute_revision_actions, on a CREATE without
  ``"dedup_adjudicated": true``, probes existing non-retired learnings via
  find_semantic_twin (embedding cosine in the index model's space) such that:

  1. NEAR-DUPLICATE IS HELD, NOT WRITTEN. A CREATE whose text is >= 0.97 cosine
     to an existing learning (the seed pair embeds at ~0.99 by the real model)
     does NOT land a second row. summary ``needs_adjudication == 1``,
     ``created == 0``, the learnings row count does NOT grow, and the single
     adjudication names the existing twin (its id + title), carries the new
     text and a real similarity >= 0.97, and asks the focused 'merge?' question.

  2. DISTINCT CREATE LANDS A NEW ROW (the control). A CREATE on an unrelated
     topic (real cosine ~0.0, far below threshold) has NO twin: it is written.
     ``created == 1``, ``needs_adjudication == 0``, the row count grows by one.
     Same path, same seed corpus, same probe — only the *semantic* distance
     differs, so the probe (not text luck or a blanket block) held the dup.

  3. KNOB ON -> OFF, two ways the diff documents:
     (a) threshold ``>= 1.0`` DISABLES the probe (Hindsight's ``_dedup_active``
         contract). With ``REFLECT_DEDUP_THRESHOLD=1.0`` the very SAME near-
         duplicate CREATE from arm 1 now LANDS a second row
         (``created == 1``, ``needs_adjudication == 0``) — proving the hold in
         arm 1 was caused by the dedup threshold knob, not anything else.
     (b) ``"dedup_adjudicated": true`` BYPASSES the probe (the keep verdict —
         the adjudicator already read both texts and ruled them distinct). The
         same near-duplicate CREATE, flagged, LANDS — and the probe is never
         even consulted on that path (asserted with a tripwire).

Falsifiability: if C1's probe were absent, arm 1 would see ``created == 1`` and
a second row. If the probe blocked blindly (not on cosine), arm 2's distinct
CREATE would also be held. If the ``>= 1.0`` disable were not wired, arm 3a
would still hold. If ``dedup_adjudicated`` did not bypass, arm 3b would hold
(and the tripwire would fire).
