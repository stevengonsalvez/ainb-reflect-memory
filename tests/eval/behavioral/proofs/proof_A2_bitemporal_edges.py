# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for A2 — bitemporal graph edges (tcommit + tvalid).

"""A2 bitemporal graph-edge proof.

Port A2 extends the S2 typed-causal-link schema so every relationship carries
TWO clocks (agentmemory GraphEdge shape):

  * tcommit    — transaction time: when reflect LEARNED the edge. Defaults to
                 the sidecar's ingest time (extracted_at) when omitted.
  * tvalid     — valid time: when the edge became true IN THE WORLD. Defaults
                 to tcommit when omitted.
  * tvalid_end — when the edge stopped being true. Set on SUPERSESSION (with
                 superseded_by) instead of deleting the edge, preserving history.

This separates "what was true in April?" (tvalid filter) from "what did we KNOW
in April?" (tcommit filter). The proof drives the REAL production code on both
surfaces with NO LLM and NO torch engine — every verdict is fully determined by
the fixtures plus the shipped pure functions, so it is deterministic.

Two arms, each seeding its OWN fresh state:

STORAGE/VALIDATION ARM (validate_sidecar.py — the linter the ingest pipeline
runs before `reflect add --entities`):
  A1. A relationship carrying tcommit + tvalid + tvalid_end (ISO dates)
      validates with ZERO bitemporal errors — the fields are accepted.
  A2. A MALFORMED timestamp ("not-a-date") is REJECTED, naming the field — a
      bad clock can't silently corrupt the graph filter.
  A3. tcommit DEFAULTS to ingest time: an edge that omits tcommit, run through
      the documented `--backfill-tcommit` knob (backfill_tcommit()), is stamped
      with the sidecar's extracted_at; an edge that already declares tcommit is
      left untouched (override is honoured).
  A4. SUPERSESSION sets tvalid_end + superseded_by WITHOUT deleting the edge:
      both the superseded edge and its replacement remain in the sidecar and
      still validate clean; a backwards window (tvalid_end < tvalid) is rejected.

RETRIEVAL ARM (recall.filter_edges_by_tvalid — the graph-arm temporal filter,
fed by the REAL R6 date parser extract_temporal_constraint):
  B1. A query that parses an APRIL window surfaces ONLY the edge valid in April
      and drops the edge superseded in March and the edge that begins in June.
  B2. WIDENING/removing the date filter (a date-free query => temporal is None)
      returns BOTH edges — the filter is a windowed booster, never a blocker.
  B3. The kill-switch (RECALL_BITEMPORAL_EDGES=0) makes a windowed query return
      every edge, proving the April result is the filter's doing, not the seed's.

Falsifiability: if tvalid were ignored, B1 would keep all edges and FAIL. If
supersession deleted instead of flipping tvalid_end, A4 would not find the old
edge and FAIL. If the timestamp validation were absent, A2 would pass with zero
errors and FAIL. If tcommit didn't default to ingest time, A3 would FAIL.

Coverage note: the retrieval arm proves the graph-arm edge filter directly via
its pure production function + the real R6 parser, NOT through the full
`reflect search --mode local` subprocess. That is deliberate: the live graph
mode synthesises community-report context and DROPS per-doc/edge ids (see
conftest's recall() docstring), so an edge-id assertion through the engine is
not observable. Driving filter_edges_by_tvalid with the real parser is the
decisive, deterministic surface for the temporal knob; the storage arm covers
on-disk persistence. NOT covered: end-to-end fusion of the filtered edge set
into served learnings (untestable without per-edge ids from the engine).
