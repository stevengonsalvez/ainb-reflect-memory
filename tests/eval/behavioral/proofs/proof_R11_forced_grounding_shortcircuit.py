# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for R11 — SessionStart short-circuits after the
# ABOUTME: single tier-1 (skills) lookup when that hit is fresh AND high-score,
# ABOUTME: skipping the lower-tier recall entirely; stale/low-score hits fall
# ABOUTME: through. The freshness + rerank-score thresholds are the only knobs.
"""R11 forced-grounding short-circuit proof.

Port R11 (surface=inject) ports Hindsight's forced-grounding short-circuit
(agent.py:305 ``_all_mental_models_are_usable_and_fresh`` + agent.py:993-1003).
It ships entirely inside ``plugins/reflect/skills/recall/hooks/session_start_
recall.py``: ``freshness_check`` + ``should_short_circuit`` decide, and
``session_start_recall_payload`` orchestrates — on a warm project the tier-1
(skills) hit is fresh and high-confidence, so SessionStart emits the skills-only
inject and NEVER spawns the lower-tier ``recall.py`` subprocess.

This is a plugin-side hook port: it does NOT change recall ranking or the
reflect-kb engine, so there is nothing for the behavioral_kb retrieval fixture
to rank. This proof therefore drives the REAL hook module directly (imported by
file path, not re-implemented) and NO LLM / no embedding model runs in any
assertion — the verdict is fully determined by a small skill dict plus the two
deterministic thresholds.

Invariants (each arm's seed + the real module fully determine the verdict):

  A. SHORT-CIRCUIT ON A WARM HIT (decisive). With the tier-1 probe returning a
     FRESH (recent age), HIGH-score skill, the REAL
     ``session_start_recall_payload`` returns the skills-only block AND the
     lower-tier recall is NEVER invoked — proven by a spy on
     ``run_lower_tier_recall`` whose call count stays 0. If the short-circuit
     were broken, the spy would fire and this assertion FAILS.

  B. FALL THROUGH ON A COLD HIT. With a STALE skill (age past the freshness
     window) the orchestrator runs the lower-tier recall (spy fires exactly
     once) and returns its payload — cold projects still get full recall.

  C. THE SCORE THRESHOLD IS THE KNOB (falsifiable). The SAME fresh skill flips
     short-circuit on/off purely as its rerank score crosses the threshold:
     score just ABOVE => short-circuit (no lower tier); score just BELOW =>
     fall through (lower tier runs). Only the score differs between the two
     calls, so the threshold — not luck — owns the decision.

  D. REAL TIER-1 PROBE PARSES A REAL RESULT (no LLM). Driving the REAL
     ``skills_tier_probe`` against a fake ``recall.py`` that emits the exact
     ``render_json`` envelope proves the probe really parses JSON, maps the
     confidence tier to a score, and derives age from ``archived_at`` — the
     dict the decision consumes is produced by shipped code, not the test.

Falsifiability: if the short-circuit didn't suppress the lower tier, arm A's
spy count would be 1 and FAIL. If freshness were ignored, arm B would
short-circuit and the spy would stay 0 and FAIL. If the score gate were a
no-op, arm C's two outcomes would be identical and FAIL.
