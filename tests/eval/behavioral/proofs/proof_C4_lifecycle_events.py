"""C4 lifecycle-events emit + per-event shell-hook proof.

Port C4 is a CONSOLIDATION/capture port (surface=consolidation). It ships
``plugins/reflect/scripts/reflect_events.py`` — a Hindsight-style local webhook
fan-out. ``recall.py`` and the GraphRAG engine never reference it: the signal is
produced entirely at *capture* time, when reflect crosses a lifecycle moment and
appends an event. So there is nothing to rank and the behavioral_kb retrieval
fixture is the wrong surface. This proof drives the REAL module directly (no
mock of the thing under test, no torch engine, no network) and the cascade call
site through ``reflect_cascade.prepare`` — and NO LLM runs in any assertion:
``emit`` is a pure append + a deterministic ``subprocess.run`` of a shell hook.

The append target is ``$REFLECT_STATE_DIR/events.jsonl`` (resolved at call time),
so each test points the env at an isolated tmp dir. The write is append-safe (a
single ``os.write`` to an ``O_APPEND`` fd), so two emits never clobber a line.

Invariants (each arm's seed + the module fully determine the verdict — no LLM):

  A. ONE LINE PER MOMENT, CORRECT SHAPE. For EVERY one of the 4 lifecycle
     events (learning.created, learning.updated, skill.refreshed,
     consolidation.completed), a single ``emit(event, payload)`` appends EXACTLY
     one line, that line is valid JSON, its ``event`` equals the name emitted,
     and its ``payload`` round-trips the dict passed in. Two emits -> exactly two
     lines, in order. This pins "events appended per lifecycle moment".

  B. CLOSED VOCABULARY. An out-of-set event name (a typo a call site could
     plausibly introduce) is REJECTED with ``UnknownEvent`` and writes NOTHING —
     proving the gate is the closed enum, not incidental I/O.

  C. HOOK FIRES ON ITS EVENT, NOT OTHERS (decisive). With a shell hook
     configured for ``skill.refreshed`` ONLY (it ``touch``es a sentinel file),
     emitting ``learning.created`` leaves the sentinel ABSENT; emitting
     ``skill.refreshed`` CREATES it. Same module, same state dir — only the
     emitted event differs — so the hook selection is the port's doing, not luck.
     This is the falsifiable arm: if hooks fired indiscriminately, the sentinel
     would exist after arm-C's first emit and the assertion would FAIL.

  D. HOOK SEES THE EVENT NAME. The configured hook can branch on the firing
     event: it writes ``$REFLECT_EVENT`` into a capture file, and that file
     contains exactly the event name that fired (proving the env contract, not
     just a blind side effect).

  E. REAL CASCADE CALL SITE. Driving the REAL ``reflect_cascade.prepare`` on a
     signal-bearing transcript (deterministically reaching the reflect path)
     appends exactly one ``consolidation.completed`` line to the SAME
     events.jsonl — proving the additive call site wired into the shipped
     cascade actually emits, not just the unit API.

Falsifiability: if emit appended zero or two lines, arm A fails. If the enum
were open, arm B's emit would write a line and the "nothing written" assertion
would FAIL. If the hook fired on every event, arm C's negative case fails. If
the cascade call site were not wired, arm E finds no event line and FAILS.
