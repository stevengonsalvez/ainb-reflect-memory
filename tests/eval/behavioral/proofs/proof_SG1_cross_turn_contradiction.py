# ABOUTME: Behavioral proof for SG1 — cross-turn contradiction detection. Writing
# ABOUTME: "use foo" then "never use foo" through the real on-disk reflect_db

"""SG1 cross-turn contradiction (belief-revision-at-capture) proof.

Port SG1 is a STORAGE/CAPTURE port. The detection + reconciliation run inside
``reflect_db.add_learning``'s post-write hook against the sqlite ``learnings``
table — they are deliberately invisible to the file-engine recall pipeline:
``recall.py`` indexes ``documents/*.md`` and never reads the sqlite
``is_latest`` flag (verified: ``grep is_latest plugins/reflect/.../recall.py``
finds only a comment). So the strongest OBSERVABLE invariant lives where the
behaviour actually executes — the real, migrated, on-disk reflect database —
and is read back exactly the way ``/reflect:status`` (the ``contradictions``
CLI / ``get_contradiction_count``) and any sqlite-aware injector read it.

This proof drives the REAL engine (no mock reflect_db, no stubbed detector): a
fresh on-disk sqlite DB with the real schema migration + concept_index backfill,
the real ``contradiction_detector`` Jaccard/polarity rule, and the real
``events.jsonl`` audit mirror written beside the DB. ``add_learning`` is the
production capture entry point.

Invariant (four linked assertions; the seeds + the negation flip fully
determine each outcome — no LLM participates):

  1. RECONCILE-TO-ONE: after writing "use foo" (turn 1) then "never use foo"
     (turn 2), exactly ONE learning is is_latest among the contradicting pair —
     the NEW negated belief. The older "use foo" row has is_latest=0 and its
     superseded_by_learning_id points at the newer row. The agent that reads
     "latest beliefs" now gets a single, non-contradictory injection instead of
     two rows fighting on independent recency. This is the first acceptance
     bullet and SG1's whole reason to exist.

  2. AUDITED: the demotion emits a ``contradiction_detected`` event in the
     sqlite events table AND mirrors it to ``events.jsonl`` beside the DB (the
     ``~/.reflect/events.jsonl`` audit file the acceptance contract pins). The
     event names the older (demoted) row and carries the newer/older pair.

  3. STATUS SURFACES IT: the ``reflect_db contradictions`` CLI — the exact
     surface ``/reflect:status`` shells out to — reports a non-zero count over
     the same on-disk DB (run as a subprocess to prove the real CLI path, not
     just the in-process counter). This is the third acceptance bullet.

  4. FALSIFIABLE CONTROL: a same-polarity RESTATEMENT in a *separate* DB
     ("never use bar" then "don't use bar") does NOT demote anything — both stay
     is_latest=1 and zero contradiction events fire. This rules out the trivial
     "demote on any high-overlap write" failure mode and pins that the
     opposite-polarity requirement is load-bearing.

Falsifiability of the main path: if SG1 were absent (no post-write hook, or a
broken detector), turn 2 would leave BOTH rows is_latest=1, no event would be
written to sqlite or events.jsonl, and the contradictions CLI would report 0 —
assertions 1, 2 and 3 would each FAIL. If the polarity check were dropped
(demote on overlap alone), assertion 4's restatement would wrongly demote and
FAIL.

Why no recall.py assertion: see the module docstring — the file engine cannot
observe sqlite is_latest, so a recall ranking assertion would be vacuous for
this port. The sqlite reconciliation above IS the closest (and authoritative)
observable; it is read by the same status surface the agent uses. The real
recall engine is still exercised by the SG1-family sibling proofs that touch
the document layer; SG1's behaviour is purely a capture-layer reconciliation.
