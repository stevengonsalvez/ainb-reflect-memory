"""S2 typed causal-link closed-enum proof.

Port S2 is a STORAGE/FORMAT port (surface=storage). Corrected against the real
diff at 33a25843 (`feat(reflect): typed causal-link enum in sidecar validator +
drain (S2 plugin half)`), the true invariant lives in the plugin's
``validate_sidecar.py`` — NOT in recall.py, so there is no recall ranking knob to
toggle. The port replaces the old open-ended pair-of-strings relationship `type`
with a CLOSED enum:

    RELATIONSHIP_TYPES = TYPED_CAUSAL_LINK_TYPES | LEGACY_RELATIONSHIP_TYPES
      TYPED_CAUSAL_LINK_TYPES = {caused_by, causes, enables, prevents,
                                 contradicts, supersedes, part_of, uses}
      LEGACY_RELATIONSHIP_TYPES = {solves, requires, relates_to,
                                   implements, configures, triggers}

``validate()`` (the real function the ingest pipeline calls before
``reflect add --entities``) emits an error for any relationship whose ``type`` is
outside that set. We drive the REAL validator on fixtures we build, with NO LLM
and NO torch engine — the validator is a pure YAML linter.

Invariant (each arm's seed + the validator fully determine the verdict — no LLM
in the assertion):

  A. ACCEPT (typed-enum membership). For EVERY one of the 8 S2 typed causal link
     types, a sidecar declaring a single relationship of that type validates with
     ZERO type errors. This pins that the closed enum *contains* the typed causal
     vocabulary the port shipped (the "graph queries gain meaning" half).

  B. REJECT (closed gate, decisive). An OTHERWISE-IDENTICAL sidecar whose only
     change is an out-of-enum relationship `type` (a value the LLM drain could
     plausibly hallucinate — e.g. `frobnicates`, `relatedto`, `CAUSES`) is
     REJECTED: validate() returns an error that names the offending type and the
     enum. Same entities, same fields, same source/target — ONLY the type differs.
     This proves the *closedness* of the enum, not incidental schema failure.

  C. KNOB TOGGLE (--backfill flips the verdict). The SAME rejected sidecar, run
     through the port's documented ``backfill()`` (the ``--backfill`` CLI flag from
     the diff), rewrites the unknown type to the ``relates_to`` default and the
     file then validates CLEAN. backfill() reports exactly 1 rewritten edge, and a
     legal typed edge in the same file is NEVER touched (0 extra rewrites). This is
     the decisive flag proof: the enum gate (not some unrelated field) owns the
     arm-B rejection, because toggling the type back inside the enum — and nothing
     else — is exactly what clears it.

Falsifiability: if the enum were still open (pre-S2), arm B would pass with zero
errors and the assertion would FAIL. If backfill did not normalize the bad type,
arm C's post-backfill validate would still error and FAIL. If backfill clobbered
legal typed edges, arm C's "typed edge untouched" assertion would FAIL.
